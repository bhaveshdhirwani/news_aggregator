The market average was recorded at 840 points. The 2017 India Sales Satisfaction Index (mass market) Study is based on responses from 7831 new-vehicle owners, who purchased vehicles between September 2016 and April 2017.\r\n\r\nThe 2017 JD Power SSI study was based on six factors that contributed to overall customer satisfaction with respect to their new-vehicle purchase experience in the mass market segment. The factors include sales initiation (17 per cent); dealer facility (17 per cent); deal and paperwork (17 per cent); delivery timing (17 per cent); salesperson (16 per cent) and delivery process (16 per cent).\r\nJD Power, in a statement said that \"the overall sales satisfaction index for the industry improved significantly.\" The SSI increased by 31 points (on a 1000 point scale) in 2016. The main factors contributing to the improvement included a higher implementation rate on process standards; increase in the number of amenities made available at dealer facilities; and a drop in pressures and problems experienced by customers during the shopping experience.\r\n\r\nThe study also concluded that satisfaction in dealer facilities factor improved year-on-year with 65 per cent of customers saying their dealer offered all the amenities measured including, Wi-Fi, comfortable seating space and product brochures among others. Furthermore, the study said that 4 per cent fewer customers experienced problems or pressure during the buying process, down from 37 per cent to 33 per cent.\r\nThe study also found that 49 per cent of new-vehicle buyers in India researched vehicles online, which is an increase of 15 percentage points from last year.\r\nIn its 18th year, the JD Power Sales Satisfation Index (SSI) saw Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki scored 838 points respectively, followed by Datsun coming in sixth with 836 points.

Ducati Team\'s Andrea Dovizioso took his fifth win of this year in the Japanese Grand Prix in a final lap showdown with points leader Marc Marquez of Honda. The riders put up one of the most dramatic finishes in MotoGP as the victor seemed uncertain down to the final \'Victory\' corner. Marquez finished a very close second with a gap of 0.249 seconds taking his 100th career podium, while Danilo Petrucci of Octo Pramac Racing finished third on the podium. Dovizioso has now closed the gap with Marquez down to 11 points; while Vinales is a distant third with 203 points.\r\n\r\nStarting from the front row, Marquez took the lead right from the start followed by Jorge Lorenzo of Ducati, Petrucci, Johann Zarco of Tech 3 Yamaha and Dovizioso further back. While Lorenzo briefly took the lead on Lap 1, Marquez was quick to fight back and regain the lead. Dovizioso had a stunning start and quickly passed rivals to take P2, as Petrucci settled into third. In the opening stages itself, it was clear that these riders will be leading the race.\r\nAs the riders lapped the track, Marquez and Dovizioso moved further away from the rest of the lot, with Petrucci keeping close company. On Lap 12, Marquez made his first move to take the lead from Dovizioso, and all eyes were now on the two riders as a cat and mouse chase was what it seemed like with the pair changing positions. Marquez seemed clear in the lead fending consistent attacks from Dovizioso.\r\nBy the final lap, the sentiment echoed that of the Red Bull Ring fight from earlier this year between the title contenders. With Marquez still in the lead, Dovizioso was trailing behind the Honda rider by less than half a second. The Italian was waiting for Marquez to make a mistake that he would take advantage of and when time came, the Dovizioso made no mistake.\r\nMarquez wobbled on Turn 8 of the final lap, allowing Dovizioso close the gap further, while the former ran wide on the final corner, the opportunity Andrea was waiting for as he made no mistake to take the lead and seal his seventh win of the career. Petrucci went to finish third, 10.38 seconds behind Dovizioso.\r\nFurther down, Suzuki\'s Andrea Iannone and Alex Rins finished fourth and fifth, securing their best result of the season. Lorenzo took the sixth spot, after leading the race briefly, and finished ahead of Aleix Espargaro of Aprilia Racing and Johann Zarco.\r\nIt wasn\'t the best day for Yamaha as Valentino Rossi as the Italian crashed on Lap 6, while Maverick Vinales finished ninth behind Zarco. Avintia Ducati\'s Loris Baz took the tenth place ahead of KTM rider Pol Espargaro. Yamaha\'s wildcard entry, Katsuyuki Nakasuga of Yamalube factory team finished 12th, ahead of Sam Lowes of Aprilia, Hector Barbera (Avintia Racing) and Tito Rabat (Marc VDS).\r\nWith respect to retirements, Honda\'s Dani Pedrosa retired from the race in the closing stages along with Cal Crutchlow of LCR Honda after two crashes. Aspar Ducati\'s Alvaro Bautista and Karel Abraham had falls and retired from the race.\r\n', 'images/auto3.jpg'),

(6, 'Man Booker prize 2017: from Abraham Lincoln to Brexit Britain', 'books', 'What do book prizes have to do with serious literature? On the long view, the answer is: not much. Even the immensely distinguished Nobel prize, which has just delighted many British readers with its choice of Kazuo Ishiguro, has logged some pretty forgettable selections. Who, for instance, still reads Rudolf Christoph Eucken (1908), Karl Adolph Gjellerup (1917), Frans Eemil Sillanpää (1939) or Nelly Sachs (1966)?\r\nIn the arts, prizes will always be a lottery. Posh panels are just as vulnerable as the rest of us to the vagaries of taste. The joy of reading is that it’s free from the thought police. Books live and die in the hearts and minds of readers. Still, for close on 50 years, Man Booker’s quixotic efforts have made surprisingly good sense of a difficult, even impossible enterprise.\r\nTaste and judgment aside, the other intractable dimension of the Booker conundrum is its annual rendezvous with the marketplace. As in farming, or finance, there are good years and bad years. 2015 and 2016 were good years with excellent winners (Marlon James’s A Brief History of Seven Killings; Paul Beatty’s The Sellout).\r\nThis year, Booker’s panel is up against it. Before we discuss the shortlist, we have to note that, for whatever good reason, the judges decided to exclude some powerful contenders: Sebastian Barry (Days Without End), Arundhati Roy (The Ministry of Utmost Happiness), Zadie Smith (Swing Time) and, perhaps most surprising of all, Colson Whitehead (The Underground Railroad).\r\nWhen Lola Young, as chair, summarised the shortlist as “unique and intrepid books that collectively push against the borders of convention”, she articulated a mission statement for a final session that promises to be an excruciating visit to the third circle of a literary critical inferno.\r\nAutumn has everything one would want from a winner: humanity, brilliance and a kind of subversive ecstasy\r\nIn practical terms, Young and her team have to choose between three Americans, an English woman, an award-winning Scot and a Pakistani. Collectively, their novels have been described by one of the judges as “transcultural”, a word still new to many dictionaries.\r\nFirst on the shortlist is Paul Auster’s 4321 (Faber), a consciously epic, quasi-cubist portrait of an American boy’s life during the second half of the last century. (Full disclosure: I was Auster’s first publisher and have been an admirer of his work ever since The New York Trilogy.)\r\n4321 offers a hefty punch from an American heavyweight. At more than 1,000 pages, the multi-form versions of the life of Archibald Isaac Ferguson demonstrates a major writer at his best – original, ambitious, pitch-perfect and wholly absorbing. This is a novel tormented by fate, contingency and playful literary experimentation. But it’s also a narrative to get lost in, a Bildungsroman that is, by chance, a poignant elegy to the America that is being trashed by Trump and his vandals. 4321 must be a real contender.\r\nInevitably, Auster’s book towers over Emily Fridlund’s History of Wolves(Weidenfeld), an enigmatic coming-of-age novel set on the edge of a lake in the American midwest. Some readers may compare Fridlund’s book unfavourably with Marilynne Robinson’s Housekeeping, which is also set by a lake, but History of Wolves is grounded in a more sinister domestic narrative that grips the reader with a fierce vision of adolescent estrangement. It’s a powerful debut.\r\nFrom these all-American narratives, we move to Britain with Fiona Mozley’s Elmet (John Murray), another first novel about secrets in the family. As her title suggests, Mozley has drunk deep at the fount of Ted Hughes and has written a dark hymn to the landscape and language of Yorkshire that’s also, like Hughes’s poetry, bleak, lyrical and steeped in blood.\r\nWhere Mozley draws on an English tradition, in Exit West (Hamish Hamilton), Mohsin Hamid strikes a global dystopian note that’s fresh, contemporary and audacious, a love story set in a disintegrating society; a novel for the moment.\r\nWhich brings us to the big American challenger here, Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (Bloomsbury), the bookies’ favourite. Saunders has been extravagantly praised in the US for his short fiction, notably CivilWarLand in Bad Decline (1996), and is, unquestionably, a highly original talent who is taking fiction into extraordinary new territory. Lincoln in the Bardo, his first novel, is a strange and haunting reverie on Abraham Lincoln’s grief at the death of his 11-year-old son, Willie, “a small mirror of himself”, in 1862. The “bardo” is the Tibetan Buddhist limbo between death and rebirth in which Lincoln’s dead son meets ghostly voices from the past in a dazzling collage of voices.\r\nYou could describe this as a postmodern historical novel, but that would be to underestimate the thrill of Saunders’s intentions. Braiding snatches of prose, both original and archival, he redefines his chosen genre with some outrageous comic touches and many arresting moments of sheer magic. Experimental yet firmly anchored to its readers’ attention, it offers the kind of satisfactions typical of many previous winners. If it had not been so wildly acclaimed, it would seem a shoo-in for this year’s prize. And yet…\r\nThere is, from the final book on this list, Ali Smith’s Autumn (Penguin), some serious competition. Smith’s is another highly acclaimed performance, the first of a four-part series about time and the seasons. Autumn is a bittersweet tour de force set in “the worst of times” – Brexit Britain – and interweaving art, death and the mysteries of love. Smith’s portrait of centenarian Daniel Gluck, approaching death, and his passionate protege, Elisabeth, is a stunning exploration of memory and regret, a book that celebrates and entertains as much as it takes us into the twilight world of the dying. On some readings, Autumn has everything one would want from a winner: humanity, brilliance and a kind of subversive ecstasy.\r\nWho knows how the judges will adjudicate this list? Almost any outcome is possible on 17 October. Who knows if what they choose is literature? That’s for posterity. My hunch is that a US writer will take the prize again, no doubt stirring up more anti-Americanism, though Smith will have a lot of home support. You never can tell.\r\n', 'images/book1.jpg'),
(7, 'Kancha Ilaiah case: We’re not here to ban books says Supreme Court', 'books', 'Supreme Court dismisses petition to ban a book written by the Dalit writer.\r\nIt is not up to the Supreme Court to use its powers to ban books, which are a free expression of a writer’s thoughts and feelings about the society and world he lives in. Courts cannot be asked to gag free expression. The Supreme Court has always placed the fundamental right to free speech at the highest pedestal.\r\nThis is what the Supreme Court recorded in its two-page order while dismissing a petition to ban a book written by writer and activist Professor Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd called Samajika Smugglurlu Komatollu .\r\nThe petition filed by advocate K.L.N.V. Veeranjaneyulu also took exception to a particular chapter in a book titled ‘Post-Hindu India’ called ‘Hindutv-Mukt Bharat’. The book is critical about the caste system prevailing in India, especially in the Arya Vysya community.\r\n “Any request for banning a book of the present nature has to be strictly scrutinized because every author or writer has a fundamental right to speak out ideas freely and express thoughts adequately. Curtailment of an individual writer/author\'s right to freedom of speech and expression should never be lightly viewed,” a Bench of Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud recorded in the order. The court dismissed the petition to uphold the fundamental right of free speech, “keeping in view the sanctity of the said right and also bearing in mind that the same has been put on the highest pedestal by this court”.\r\nThe court snubbed the petitioner, observing that his prayer to ban the book of Prof. Shepherd is rather an “ambitious” one. “When an author writes a book, it is his or her right of expression. We do not think that it would be appropriate under Article 32 of the Constitution of India that this court should ban the book/books,” the Supreme Court held.\r\nProf. Shepherd had recently challenged his detractors in the Arya Vysya community, saying he was prepared to withdraw his book of the representatives of the community were prepared to earmark 5% jobs in their establishments to Dalits, Adivasis and members from the washermen and barber communities.\r\n', 'images/book2.jpg'),
(8, 'To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee taken off Mississippi school reading list', 'books', 'To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee’s classic novel about racism and the American south, has been removed from a junior-high reading list in a Mississippi school district because the language in the book “makes people uncomfortable”.\r\nThe Sun Herald reported that administrators in Biloxi pulled the novel from the 8th-grade curriculum this week.\r\nKenny Holloway, vice-president of the Biloxi School Board, told the newspaper: “There were complaints about it. There is some language in the book that makes people uncomfortable, and we can teach the same lesson with other books. It’s still in our library. But they’re going to use another book in the 8th-grade course.”\r\nA message on the Biloxi schools website said To Kill A Mockingbird teaches students that compassion and empathy do not depend upon race or education.\r\nPublished in 1960, Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winner deals with racial inequality in a small Alabama town, in the aftermath of an alleged rape of a white woman for which a black man is tried. It has sold more than 40m copies and it was made into a film in 1962, winning three Oscars.\r\nAn email to the Sun Herald from a concerned reader referred to the book’s use of the word “nigger” when it said the school board’s decision was made “mid-lesson plan”. “The students will not be allowed to finish the reading of To Kill A Mockingbird,” the email said “… due to the use of the ‘N’ word.”\r\nThe newspaper quoted the reader as writing: “I think it is one of the most disturbing examples of censorship I have ever heard, in that the themes in the story humanize all people regardless of their social status, education level, intellect, and of course, race. It would be difficult to find a time when it was more relevant than in days like these.”\r\nThe Sun Herald reported that school board Superintendent Arthur McMillan did not answer any questions about the withdrawal. The book has been withdrawn from schools before, in 2016 in Virginia.\r\nLee died last year at the age of 89, after the discovery and controversial publication of a second novel, Go Set a Watchman, that describes events after those depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird. In June this year, the author’s estate approved plans for a graphic novel version of the first book.\r\n', 'images/book3.jpg'),
(9, 'Philip Pullman\'s The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage review: a rich dreamlike prequel well worth the wait', 'books', 'A decade-and-a-half after The Amber Spyglass, Philip Pullman returns to the world of His Dark Materials with the first in a new trilogy. “Eagerly anticipated” isn’t the half of it. I well remember asking after His Dark Materials in a bookshop, back when the buzz was first building, and being directed to the children’s section. I assumed the person who’d recommended it had made a mistake and left empty-handed. But what a difference a few years make…\r\n\r\nIn art, as in life. La Belle Sauvage is a prequel – set 10 years or so before the events of Northern Lights. It reacquaints us with many of the characters from the original books. There are cameos from Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter, with her sinister beauty and her inscrutable monkey-daemon; we meet a younger version of the elderly Gyptian Farder Coram; and Pullman’s heroine Lyra is here too… except, rather than reading alethiometers and transforming the fortunes of the multiverse, this time her main role is to gurgle prettily and fill her nappy at inconvenient times. We all have to start somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe hero of this story, rather, is Malcolm, a boy on the verge of adolescence who helps out at his parents’ waterfront pub, the Trout, in the steampunk Oxford familiar from Northern Lights. His pride and joy is a canoe called La Belle Sauvage – and he takes a dim view of the acquaintance who thought it funny to scrawl out the V and replace it with an S. (You may, like me, develop a sneaking regard for this acquaintance.)\r\n\r\nThe plot gets going when, after witnessing a stranger dropping a secret message before being apprehended by a pair of thugs, Malcolm gets drawn into a world of politico-religious subterfuge. On one side are the theocratic fascists of the Magisterium – their sinister Stasi being the agents of the CCD (Consistorial Court of Discipline); on the other a shadowy resistance movement known as Oakley Street.\r\n\r\nAt issue, as ever, are the properties of Dust and the fate of baby Lyra, who is being semi-secretly sheltered by the nuns at the nearby priory. The surveillance state sends its roots deep. Echoing Morton Rhue’s minor classic The Wave, Malcolm’s school is taken over by a youth movement – the League of St Alexander – whose members are invited to inform on heretics and soon have the teachers terrified of their charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial and psychological commentary is seldom far from the surface. Like Milton, a quote from whom gave the His Dark Materials trilogy its title, Pullman has a design on the reader. Milton wanted to “justify the ways of God to man”; Pullman wants to do, roughly, the opposite – though his assault is less against an enfeebled Authority than the oppressive and obscurantist religions that claim to act in His Name.\r\n\r\nAnd like Tolkien, world-building is at least as much of a preoccupation as storytelling: over the first trilogy Pullman unfolded a whole existential set-up that mashed up the languages of magic and quantum physics to incorporate versions of the Many-Worlds hypothesis, a twisted-Milton creation mythos and, in Dust (also “dark matter”), a sort-of-materialist account of the Hard Problem of Consciousness. That’s quite some going for a children’s book.\r\n\r\nThis being a prequel, we can take the set-up – the workings of Dust and alethiometers and daemons and all that jazz – more or less as read, even if those revelations lie in the future for the characters in the book. Yet Pullman, generously, makes sure that you can come to this one fresh without having to read, or reread, what went before. The great metaphysical edifice of His Dark Materials is, for the most part, in the background.\r\n', 'images/book4.jpeg'),

That said, for approximately nine minutes, you may have minor concerns. Will this film merely coast on the cosy lovability that made its forebear (sorry) such a joy? How can the bar be nudged up, and who’s going to do it?\r\n\r\nEveryone’s favourite ursine Peruvian immigrant left his debut in such a warm and happy place, there’s a nagging lack of comic friction as we dive back in. The Brown family, living in their perfect multicultural haven of Windsor Gardens, are trying out some new eccentric hobbies, are they? Forgive us, makers of Paddington 2, for a light tapping of feet.\r\n\r\nImpatience is dispelled for good as the plot kicks in, and it turns out – with all due respect to returning leads Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins, not to mention Ben Whishaw’s cuddly vocal work – to be all about the guest stars. The first set-piece to get dear, disaster-prone Paddington spinning from the rafters involves a barbershop, a prone Tom Conti as a pompous judge, and a set of vibrating clippers. We start to feel in safe hands once again, but it takes this burst of skittering chaos to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd then Hugh Grant arrives. Essentially filling Nicole Kidman’s shoes as this instalment’s star villain, his role as a deliciously self-absorbed West End acting legend called Phoenix Buchanan is the gift that keeps on giving.\r\n\r\nThrough his machinations – it’s all to do with an antique pop-up book Paddington covets, which contains the clues, quite without him knowing, to a long-lost treasure stash – the poor bear is framed for robbery, and sentenced by a vindictive Conti to 10 years in jail.\r\n\r\nHis letters to beloved, 100-year-old Aunt Lucy suddenly have a mournful bent, though he does find time, by way of silver linings, to praise the prison’s imposing Victorian architecture and tip-top security.\r\n\r\nReturning director Paul King, in cahoots with new co-writer Simon Farnaby, proves that the crackpot inspiration that powered his first one was no fluke. Prison is exactly the place for Paddington, in the sense that his understated melancholy makes him seem even more adorable behind bars. The shadow of his outsider status returns, and there’s a whole new set of characters for him to win over with his quaint, flummoxed ways.', 'images/book5.jpg'),
(11, 'Tata Tele deal: How Airtel is getting a billion-dollar business for free', 'business', 'After Telenor ASA decided to hand over its India mobile business to Bharti Airtel Ltd for free, the Tata group has done the same. In the June quarter, revenues of these companies together stood at Rs3,202 crore, or nearly $2 billion on an annualized basis. Sure, since Tata’s non-mobile businesses, such as broadband, are being retained, the actual revenue that could potentially accrue to Airtel could be lower.\r\nStill, even using conservative estimates, the Tatas are transferring at least a $1 billion business to Airtel for free. Telenor’s annualized revenues stood at $606 million in the June quarter.\r\nIn fact, the Tatas have gone a step further compared to Telenor. For the latter, Airtel agreed to take over outstanding spectrum payments, other operational contracts such as tower leases and employees. But the deal with the Tatas is even sweeter; it will take over only a portion of outstanding spectrum payments and it’s not clear whether operational contracts and employees are part of the deal.\r\nThe simple reason Airtel is able to strike such deals is that it is the only buyer in the market. Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have enough on their plate with their own merger, and the last thing they would want to engage with is the integration of another telco. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, after having spent Rs2 trillion already in building its network, appears self-sufficient. Of course, these are also distress sales, given the high-cash burn at these companies. For sellers, therefore, one big hope is if Airtel evinces some interest. The only other option is to wind down the business, which entails far higher costs.\r\nA Tata Sons executive told Mint the cost of winding down the business would have been about Rs8,000 crore higher than the current arrangement. Knowing this well, Airtel has stayed shy of rushing into deals, and has waited till sellers agree to its terms.\r\nThis puts it in an enviable position; such takeovers help grow market share as well as help plug gaps in its spectrum portfolio at a fairly low cost.

It will also us help reduce cost of funds by 3-4 per cent,\" IndusInd Bank managing director and chief executive Ramesh Sobti said.\r\nEarlier this afternoon, the boards of both the lenders separately decided on the merger and approved the share swap ratio wherein BFIL shareholders will get 639 shares of IndusInd for every 1,000 shares held.\r\nThe balance-sheet of BFIL, including the entire capital, assets and liabilities will move into IndusInd, while the operation team will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary and work as business correspondents.\r\nThe combined entity will have 40,000 employees, Sobti said, stating all the 15,000 employees of BFIL will be absorbed and continue in the same role. However, the board of the Hinduja Group promoted bank will remain unchanged.\r\nThe IndusInd scrip closed 0.43 per cent up at Rs 1,750.15 on the BSE on Friday, while BFIL shares closed 0.38 per cent up at Rs 1,003.45.\r\nSobti conceded that there is a 12-13 per cent premium over the average stock prices in the past two weeks which BFIL shareholders will get, but justified it on the Rs 9,500-crore loan book which his bank gets and also the synergies that will deliver higher value going forward.\r\nThe merger, expected to take up to 10 months to consummate, will help the bank in its rural play, where it has only 250 of its 1,210 branches, Sobti said.\r\nBFIL\'s network touches 1 lakh villages across the country and the merger will help it act as a full service bank rather than the monoline micro-loan provider, BFIL managing director and chief executive MR Rao said.\r\nIn the past few months, speculation has been strong about BFIL\'s suitor, especially after repeated attempts by the microlender which has survived multiple crises to turn into a small finance bank have failed. Many of its peers did manage to turn into the new-age entities.\r\nPH Ravi Kumar, non-executive chairman of BFIL, said the merger is not \"an easy one\" for the MFI and shared a trivia by stating that the announcement comes on the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Andhra MFI Act, which had led to doubts over the very survival of the sector.\r\nThis regulatory overreach had forced BFIL, floated by the high profile Vikram Akula as SKS Microfinance, and taken to a historic IPO in 2010 making it the first MFI to go public, to even change to its present name. The Andhra law left every player bleeding for a few years and forced RBI to bring the sector under its purview.\r\nBFIL feels only two areas of the banking segment -- the lower-middle class and those around poverty line --are the ones accretive to margins and when coupled with the full range of service offerings, the merger is a win-win.\r\nSobti elaborated saying that apart from reducing cost of funds, merger will help IndusInd not just achieve the priority sector lending sub-targets but also exceed them, making it a player in the PSL certificates market that is fee-accretive.\r\nBecause of the lower risk weights attached to lending by banks, it will help conserve capital as well, Sobti added, adding \"the merger is value accretive from day one.\"\r\nWhen asked about the structure of absorbing the balance sheet and keeping operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sobti said it is in sync with past precedents which have been cleared by the regulators and will also help maintain the ethos of the company.\r\nThe merger, which comes amid a surge in agri loan losses by banks, will increase share of micro loans to 7 per cent of the loan book of IndusInd from 2.8 per cent now, Sobti said, but will dip to 5 per cent over the next three years.\r\nAsserting that microloan segment is \"high yielding and has low delinquency rates\", Sobti said it will not lead to much troubles on the asset quality as BFIL has a 99.6 per cent repayment levels in this calendar year, after the note-bank hiccups stabilised.\r\nRao chipped in saying demonetisation led to a Rs 400- crore loan loss for BFIL, but it has been fully provided.\r\nThe deal will have to pass through a slew of regulators such as the Reserve Bank, National Company Law Board Tribunal and fair-play watchdog CCI.', 'images/business4.jpg'),

Designer duo Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla have created the costumes for the film and we couldn’t help but get on call with them for more insight on the wardrobe (and plot) details. Vogue spoke to one half of the designer duo, Sandeep Khosla, about what went into the making of Veere Di Wedding’s costumes.\r\n\r\nWhat did you have in mind when setting the tone for the movie via costumes?\r\nThe brief given to us was that it’s a chick flick in a way, but it’s also about emancipation of women. Rhea (Kapoor) was very clear that she wanted one look to be men’s sherwanis.\r\n\r\nWhat inspired you to try a vibrant palette of yellows, greens and tangerines for the first look?\r\nThe first poster is a bit of a tease—you can see the girls but you can’t really see them. The colour palette was our take on the marigold flower, which is also a part of the poster.\r\n\r\nTell us about your experience styling the four stars of the film.

If somebody is a rebel, then it shows in their clothes.\r\n\r\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced as designers while working on Veere Di Wedding?\r\nNo challenges! The girls have been very supportive. They have really imbibed the vibe of their characters and the clothes and the whole experience of it. From whatever working stills I have seen of the movie—they all seem to be having a blast. Other than Sonam, we had never worked with Kareena, Swara or Shikha before. Kareena was more than happy to experiment different styles. Rhea really had a vision for the film and the thought process has come through. Originally, the plan was to go completely crazy with the fashion element of the film, but we made the brief a little more realistic.\r\n\r\nWhat palette have you relied on for this film?\r\nAs the film is about four girls bonding, we have got them in colour stories in places but otherwise they have independent styles. The clothes are not typical bridal clothes.\r\n\r\nThe second poster of Veere Di Wedding had all four stars looking sharp in co-ordinated sherwanis. Can a bride really step out in a sherwani?\r\nMaybe not the bride (laughs). But having your bridesmaids in sherwanis can be a really cool idea.\r\n\r\nWhat is your ultimate tip for Indian brides this season?\r\nMore and more brides are moving away from jadau jewellery and wearing diamonds, and white diamonds with red just looks awkward.

Even when it tries to do the right thing, it often only manages to remind the world just how tone deaf it really is.\r\n\r\nTerry Richardson is a fashion and celebrity photographer who has worked with everyone from Beyonce and Miley Cyrus to Barack Obama. He is a skilled shooter, but one who has long had an extraordinarily sleazy reputation for being sexually abusive to models. In public, he\'s recognisable thanks to his signature style, which includes work shirts, long sideburns, a moustache and eyeglasses that give him the incongruous look of a nerdy pornographer.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, New York magazine published a profile of him detailing the often sordid nature of his work. While the story contained all the usual biographical data points and resume highlights, it also made it clear that Richardson was known for being an awful person who regularly coerced models into sexually compromising circumstances. At the time the story was published, there were still people willing to defend Richardson, who took pains to acknowledge his accomplishments as a photographer. But after it ran, the magazine published a follow-up that included the personal stories of models who alleged that Richardson had been a sexual bully and worse. Richardson, for his part, seemed to view himself as a somewhat tortured and unfairly maligned artist who sometimes happened to work nude.\r\n\r\nRichardson was mostly unscathed by the stories.\r\n\r\nNow, however, a certain mainstream segment of the fashion industry has decided to formally distance itself from him. The Daily Telegraph, London reported that in a leaked e-mail from Conde Nast International, the publishing house banned Richardson from working for the company\'s publications, which include such titles as Vogue and GQ.

(26, 'Americans are paying $10 per half an hour of Zen. After yoga focus shifts to meditation', 'fitness', 'The demand for meditation is spreading across American cities -- perhaps a natural continuation of the yoga craze, which firmly embedded the search for nirvana in the health and wellbeing industry. It is 5 pm, otherwise known as rush hour in Manhattan. Julia Lyons, 31, finishes work and heads straight for her daily dose of peace and quiet -- half an hour at meditation studio “Mndfl.” Since April 2016, when she discovered the then-brand new studio, the investment bank employee has abandoned yoga and embraced meditation.\r\n“I have been meditating pretty regularly -- probably five times a week, 30-minute sessions,” says Lyons, sipping a cup of tea on the studio’s sofa. “I just need a moment to chill out. This city -- you are always running place to place and there are not a lot of quiet spaces,” she explains.\r\n“I think it’s made me a lot happier and also just helped me make better decisions, more thoughtful decisions.” Practiced by millions around the world, meditation promotes mental wellbeing through concentration, breathing techniques and self-awareness.\r\nFor a long time, those singing its praises were intellectuals, celebrities or people dedicated to spirituality. Its popularity in the West is owed in part to the Beatles, who promoted the practice on their return from India in the late 1960s.\r\nBut these days, meditation can be found in all areas of life -- from hospitals exploring its benefits for patients with serious illnesses, to schools who recommend it for children and television shows. The craze is a result of many factors -- waning attendance at places of worship, lives spent submerged in smartphones, not to mention neuroscientists’ confirmation of the benefits.\r\nAs a result, demand is spreading across American cities -- perhaps a natural continuation of the yoga craze, which firmly embedded the search for nirvana in the health and wellbeing industry.\r\nLodro Rinzler, Mndfl’s 34-year-old “chief spiritual officer,” opened his first studio in Greenwich Village at the end of 2015, and now owns two others in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Elsewhere in the US, studios can be found in Los Angeles, Miami, Washington and Boston.\r\nIntroduced to meditation as a child by his parents, who converted to Buddhism in the 1970s, he says business “is going well.” “The people who come here are really a cross section of all New Yorkers,” he explains. “If the common denominator is, ‘I am really stressed out, I need to know how to deal with my mind’ -- that’s basically everyone.”\r\nRinzler refuses to talk money, revealing only that classes are often full -- and the 75 numbered pads in his studios have been reserved online 70,000 times in just 18 months. The reason for success? A model offering a well-rounded introduction to this ancient practice for a reasonable price.\r\nFor years, Rinzler explains, Buddhist centers only offered long introductions -- sessions of several hours, or even seminars lasting a number of days and costing up to several thousand dollars.\r\nWith classes priced at just $10 for half an hour, and options for unlimited subscriptions, new studios in New York or Los Angeles hope to capture a wider audience. Their model is similar to gyms, but with “zen” in abundance -- including dimmed lights, plant walls, and unlimited organic tea.\r\n- CEOs join, employees follow -\r\nCompanies are also reaping meditation’s benefits. More and more organizations in Silicon Valley and other sectors are introducing employees to the practice, convinced of the long-term benefits for the workforce.\r\nEmily Fletcher, an ex-actress who has taught meditation since 2012, launched a special program for companies 18 months ago. Starting from 150 students in the first year, she now has over 7,000 -- and hopes to reach tens of thousands more with online courses, including in medium-sized cities such as Cleveland, Ohio or Tallahassee, Florida.\r\n“The most common way that I find myself teaching at companies is I teach the CEOs to meditate, and they start to benefit and they bring me on to do a talk with the company,” Fletcher, CEO of Ziva Meditation, says. Employees take part on a voluntary basis, mostly “for some selfish reasons,” the 38-year-old explains.\r\n“Either they want to speak better, please their boss, want to make more money or have better sex...”\r\nBut Fletcher insists she has no issue with people starting out of self-interest. “If you actually practice you will start enjoying your life more, your brain will function better, your body will feel better, you get sick less often,” she says. “Those altruistic things will happen as a result of the practice anyway.”\r\n- Mobile meditation -\r\nAnother aspect of the industry gaining traction is meditation apps. One of the most popular, Headspace, had already been downloaded more than 11 million times in the spring -- and boasts over 400,000 paying users.\r\nBut meditation’s newfound popularity is of such high intensity, neither Rinzler nor Fletcher is concerned about competing studios popping up over time.\r\n“I am sure they are going to be exactly like yoga studios, you are going to find them on every block...” Rinzler predicts. “If you look at it as a business, there is competition,” Fletcher reflects, adding, “if you see it as a mission, there are colleagues.”\r\n“There are not too many teachers when it comes to teaching four billion people in my lifetime!”\r\n', 'images/fit1.jpg'),

It could be the key to ageing well', 'fitness', 'Chinese and Canadian researchers have found evidence to suggest that a healthy gut could be linked to healthy ageing. Carried out by researchers from Ontario’s Western University and Lawson Health Research Institute as well as from Tianyi Health Science Institute in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China, the research is one of the largest microbiota studies conducted in humans, looking at a cohort of more than 1,000 Chinese participants. Previous research too has shown that gut bacteria can slow down ageing.\r\nThe researchers studied the gut bacteria in individuals, who were aged 3 to over 100 years old and self-reported as being “extremely healthy” with no known health problems and no family history of disease. The team observed a direct correlation between health and the microbes in the intestine, finding that the overall microbiota composition of the healthy elderly group was similar to that of people decades younger, with little difference between the gut microbiota of those age 30 to those age over 100.\r\n“This demonstrates that maintaining diversity of your gut as you age is a biomarker of healthy ageing, just like low-cholesterol is a biomarker of a healthy circulatory system,” commented Greg Gloor, the principal investigator on the study and also a professor at Western’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry and Scientist at Lawson Health Research Institute.\r\nThe study didn’t identify the cause or effect between gut microbiota and healthy ageing, with Gregor Reid, professor at Western’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry and Scientist at Lawson Health Research Institute saying, “It begs the question — if you can stay active and eat well, will you age better, or is healthy ageing predicated by the bacteria in your gut?”\r\nHowever, Gloor added that, “The main conclusion is that if you are ridiculously healthy and 90 years old, your gut microbiota is not that different from a healthy 30-year-old in the same population.” The researchers now suggest that resetting microbiota in the elderly to that of a 30-year-old might help promote health.\r\n“The aim is to bring novel microbiome diagnostic systems to populations, then use food and probiotics to try and improve biomarkers of health,” said Reid, adding, “By studying healthy people, we hope to know what we are striving for when people get sick.” The findings can be found published online in the journal mSphere.', 'images/fit2.jpg'),

At 14%, the proportion of children eating protein once a day is even lower, showed the survey by Podar Education Group which runs over 100 schools spread across the country.\r\nThe survey involved responses from 1,350 parents of children studying in grade six to 10 in India’s metro cities. The results showed that only 35% of children consume vegetables as part of every meal. “The World Health Organisation (WHO) does say that childhood obesity is an ‘exploding nightmare’ in the developing world,” said Raghav Podar, Trustee, Podar Education Group, in a statement.\r\nA new study led by Imperial College London and WHO and published in the journal Lancet showed that the number of obese children and adolescents (aged five to 19 years) worldwide has risen tenfold in the past four decades. “Healthy childhoods are critical to the country, and require strong cohesive work between the parents and schools,” Podar said.\r\nThe survey evaluating the eating habits across food categories in young school children in India also found that 50% of them consume junk food, sweets or other unhealthy food almost on a daily basis. “This survey clearly indicates that teaching a child about good nutrition is not just about giving them a list of healthy foods that he or she can eat, but more about ‘how much’ and ‘when’ to eat,” child nutritionist Sripriya Venkiteswaran said.\r\n“For example, teach them about age-appropriate portion sizes and how to limit themselves when they go out to birthday parties or buffet spreads. Teach them to eat at regular intervals, not skip meals and keep a gap of at least three hours between dinner and bed-time,” Venkiteswaran added.\r\nThe silver lining is that almost 76% of parents said that their kids play some outdoor sport. About 24% said their children do not play outdoors at all. “It is important for every child to have 60 minutes of moderately rigorous play every day to be fitter and healthier.

The team found that there were 74 million obese boys aged 5-19 in 2016, up from six million four decades earlier.\r\nFor girls, the tally swelled from five million to 50 million. By comparison, there were 117 million underweight boys and 75 million underweight girls last year after the number peaked around the year 2000, the study said.\r\nAlmost two thirds of the underweight children lived in south Asia. Obesity ballooned in every region in the world, while the number of underweight children slowly decreased everywhere except south and southeast Asia, and central, east and west Africa.\r\nThe prevalence of underweight children decreased from 9.2 percent to 8.4 percent of girls aged 5-19 over the study period, and from 14.8 percent to 12.4 percent in boys. Obesity grew from 0.7 percent to 5.6 percent among girls and from 0.9 percent to 7.8 percent in boys.\r\nIn Nauru, the Cook Islands and Palau, more than 30 percent of children and teenagers were obese in 2016.

These range from underweight, normal weight, overweight and three categories of obese. Obesity comes with the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, while underweight children are more at risk from infectious diseases.\r\nChildren in either category can be stunted if their diet does not include healthy nutrients. “There is a continued need for policies that enhance food security in low-income countries and households, especially in south Asia,” said study author Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London.\r\n“But our data also shows that the transition from underweight to overweight and obesity can happen quickly in an unhealthy nutritional transition with an increase in nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods.” The team used the height and weight data of 129 million people older than five to estimate body mass trends for 200 countries from 1975 to 2016.\r\nWhile obesity in children and teens appears to have plateaued in rich countries, its rise continued in low- and middle-income countries, they found. “Very few policies and programmes attempt to make healthy foods such as whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables affordable to poor families,” Ezzati said in a statement. “Unaffordability of healthy food options to the poor can lead to social inequalities in obesity, and limit how much we can reduce its burden.”', 'images/fit4.jpg'),

Regardless of the weather outside, we need to keep up with the pace. This winter, try these four methods to be full of life:\r\n\r\n1) Warm drinks\r\n\r\nIn winters, try swapping sodas, fruit juice and sparkling water for warm drinks. Sipping warm -- not boiling hot -- drinks before and after meals helps prevent the loss of heat while also favouring digestion. Herbal teas with lemon, ginger, rosemary, fennel, aniseed and cinnamon warm the body and invigorate. Try them instead of tea or coffee for breakfast. For those with nervous temperaments or who are quick to anger, sip on peppermint tea, which is stimulating but fresher.\r\n\r\n2) Eat orange\r\n\r\nTo load up on antioxidants and tasty flavours, tuck into topical vegetables. These seasonal stars are mostly yellow or orange in colour, and grow underground on the surface, like carrots, beetroot, parsnips, pumpkins, potatoes and sweet potatoes. Your gut will thank you for the soothing effect of these easy-to-digest veggies. Foods that particularly invigorate the spleen and kidneys -- veritable reservoirs of energy -- are dates, grapes, pears, potatoes, cucumber, carrots, melon, cereals, licorice, honey, cinnamon and aniseed.\r\n\r\n3) Get to bed early\r\n\r\nIt’s not always easy to slow the pace with today’s ultra-connected and busy lifestyles. When the days get shorter, we should, however, respect this drop in energy and slow down our activities. Unless you’re a natural night owl, you can snuggle up in bed from 10:30pm with no reason to feel guilty. Reading a book, doing breathing exercises, inhaling in a few drops of essential oils (Roman camomile, lavender, niaouli) or listening to music can help you drop off.\r\n\r\n4) Try yin yoga\r\n\r\nClose to meditation, yin yoga is a slow and gentle stress-bursting activity that’s a great for fall. Holding floor-based poses for three to four minutes forces us to slow down and listen to the feelings and sensations of the present moment. This “time out” can be highly beneficial in the evening, to stretch the body thoroughly and nourish the immune system. If you have trouble getting motivated to go out, try an online class in the comfort of your home.', 'images/fit5.jpg'),

You might want to hear this out. Coffee is a natural dehydrator; and excess of it can leave you with a parched mouth which creates a favorable environment for the growth of oral bacteria. The dehydrating effect of coffee reduces the flow of saliva, which hinders the washing down of these oral bacteria. These bacteria then linger in your mouth for long and cause bad breath. Drinking water after short spurts of time can help wash down these bacteria and cut down the foul smell significantly. \r\n\r\n4. Tuna\r\n\r\n Fish, especially the protein packed Tuna, have long been associated with bad breath. Seafood starts smelling sour and foul with time as it reacts with the acid present in the mouth. You can pop a mint gum or tablet right after your meal or slash some vinegar on the fish before digging in, this prevents the oxidized odour. \r\n\r\n5. Dairy\r\n\r\nA tall glass of milk may do wonders for your body and overall health but excess of it may leave you with bad oral odour. The naturally occurring bacteria around the tongue feed on the amino acids found in milk and cheese, which can result in a foul smell from the mouth. But that doesn’t mean you toss milk or other dairy from your diet completely. Follow it up with a glass or two of water and your breath is back to smelling fine. \r\n\r\nYou need not eliminate these foods from your diet, with a  little moderation and a little caution you can avoid bad breath. Rinsing your mouth after every meal is an age-old advise that we must practice throughout our lives.

The Flexitarian Diet is more about making a conscious decision to move away from a meat-heavy diet and embrace eating habits that include more of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes and lentils. With a growing body of medical evidence swinging in the favour of a vegetarian diet, the Flexitarian Diet allows one to have the best of both worlds. Practitioners of this diet gradually make a shift away from a diet rich in meats and other animal produce and include more of vegetarian and plant-based ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nUndeniably, our contemporary diets are loaded with simple carbohydrates, refined and processed items and animal products. Fruits, veggies, legumes, beans and lentils are fast disappearing from an average Indian plate - this aptly points at the growing incident of rampant nutrient deficiencies like protein, iron and vitamin D among others.\r\n\r\nSimply put, the term \'flexitarian\' stands for a diet of a person who is flexible in his/her dietary approach. Remember, the diet does not aim to turn you into a vegetarian but to gradually reduce your dependence on animal products and make you consume more plant-based foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to practice Flexitarianism\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #1 - Make it a point to include more veggies in your diet. Load up on whole grains, legumes, beans, lentils.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #2 - Start cutting down on meat simultaneously; if you are used to consuming meat or animal products in most of your meals, go meatless completely during lunch or dinner. Gradually observe meatless days if you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #3 - Consume less of red meat; processed meats should be avoided completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #4 - Create a diet plan that is sustainable, eco-friendly, long-lasting - the one that promotes good health without having you to compromise on your dietary preferences.\r\n\r\nFlexitarianism is for those who want to take a step to adopt a healthier diet. It is specifically addressed to those who are mindful of the growing amount of meat and animal products in their daily diets and the associated threats to human health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Flexitarian is the combination of two words: Flexible + Vegetarian.

Every time I ate meat I felt like I was being a bad, lazy vegetarian. So I developed this style of eating for people who know that vegetarianism is one of the healthiest and smartest ways to eat, but don\'t want to sit in the corner at a BBQ with an empty bun.

It\'s vital nutrition, like a vitamin.\"\r\n\r\nChicken feed is usually prepared as a corn-soybean mixture, and methionine is the sole essential sulfur-containing amino acid that\'s missing, the study says.\r\n\r\nThe Rutgers scientists inserted an E. coli bacterial gene into the corn plant\'s genome and grew several generations of corn. The E. coli enzyme -- 3?-phosphoadenosine-5?-phosphosulfate reductase (EcPAPR) -- spurred methionine production in just the plant\'s leaves instead of the entire plant to avoid the accumulation of toxic byproducts, Leustek said. As a result, methionine in corn kernels increased by 57 percent, the study says.\r\n\r\nThen the scientists conducted a chicken feeding trial at Rutgers and showed that the genetically engineered corn was nutritious for them, Messing said.\r\n\r\n\"To our surprise, one important outcome was that corn plant growth was not affected,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn the developed world, including the U.S., meat proteins generally have lots of methionine, Leustek said. But in the developing world, subsistence farmers grow corn for their family\'s consumption.\r\n\r\n\"Our study shows that they wouldn\'t have to purchase methionine supplements or expensive foods that have higher methionine,\" he said.', 'images/food5.jpg'),

(37, 'Middle-earth: Shadow Of War Graphics Settings Guide And PC Performance Tips', 'gaming', 'Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor was a marquee game for benchmarking PCs back in 2014 with its expansive environments and chaotic action sequences. The recently released sequel, Shadow of War, follows suit, and we figured this new adventure into Mordor is ripe for a quick graphics settings guide with some performance tips. It\'s an open-world action game, so twitch reactions and precision aiming aren\'t really part of the equation. It\'s not exactly necessary to maintain 60+ frames-per-second (FPS), but of course you want a smooth experience with as much eye candy as possible. Shadow of War\'s System Requirements  The game uses Monolith\'s own Firebird graphics engine (formerly known as LithTech), and despite having large, detailed environments, the system requirements aren\'t too demanding. However, for a more optimal experience on PC, the recommended specs provide more than enough juice as you\'ll see in our results.  Minimum requirements:      CPU: Intel Core i5-2300 / AMD FX-4350     GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 / AMD HD 7870     Memory: 6 GB RAM     Disk Space: 70 GB  Recommended:      CPU: Intel Core i7-3770 / AMD FX-8350     GPU: Nvidia GTX 970 or 1060 / AMD RX 480 or 580     Memory: 12 GB RAM  For the purposes of our tests, we\'re using a mid-range system that closely represents the recommended specs for the game. Our PC includes an Intel Core i5-3570K CPU, MSI GTX 970 GPU, and 8GB of RAM. A Look At Our Graphics Options  Let\'s take a quick look at our options. We\'re sticking with 1080p for our resolution, but there are more than enough choices here, even allowing you to try 8K (7680x4320). V-Sync helps prevent screen tearing, although we prefer to keep it off. Dynamic resolution helps maintain consistent performance by adapting resolution in real time to how demanding the game gets; you can set the floor for how low the resolution goes.  While Shadow Of War has six graphical quality presets, we\'re going custom here. Lighting, Shadows, Mesh qualities are all set to High. Texture quality is also set to High since Ultra is specifically for the 4K texture pack and requires a video card with at least 8GB of video memory. Tessellation adds more three-dimensional detail to surfaces based on mapping data; we kept this on for more visual flair. Depth of Field is an effect that blurs areas that aren\'t at the focus of the player, and you should set this to your preference. The game doesn\'t specify what type of ambient occlusion techniques it uses outright, but we found Medium to be a good balance between performance and visual quality with our specs. For anti-aliasing, we used TAA (temporal anti-aliasing). It\'s an increasingly popular technique to get rid of jaggies, since it hits a nice balance of quality and performance. You\'ll definitely want this on over FXAA (fast approximate anti-aliasing), which tends to look too blurry. Texture filtering should be set to Ultra; this basically means anisotropic filtering is set to 16x.  Shadow of War does a great job of showing you what\'s going behind these graphics settings. Not only does the game explain what each setting does, but it gives you a breakdown of how the settings affect system memory and VRAM consumption. It even provides you with a neat little benchmark tool to get specific frame-time readings and FPS results through a 60-second fly by of an in-engine sequence, which is how we tested our systems. Running On Recommended Specs  With our modest system close to the recommended specs and aforementioned choices in graphics settings, the benchmark results showed an average of 71 FPS. It hit a minimum of 41 FPS but just for a brief moment it got as high as 96 FPS. For the most part, the live FPS readings were consistently between the mid-60s to mid-70s. This gives you a little wiggle room if you want to bump a few other options up a notch. Verdict  There were slight hitches during normal gameplay, but they were few and far between and inconsequential to the game\'s action in our experience. Visually, the game looks a little flat overall, but the PC version of Middle-earth: Shadow of War runs exceptionally well, even on modest hardware. But we were also reminded that 60 FPS at 4K resolution with the highest visual quality in modern games is still tough to attain unless you\'re willing the shell out the big bucks for the best video card available.', 'images/3301667-sowbenchmark.jpg'),

However, in a recent interview with GameSpot, Xbox head Phil Spencer did say we’d see the first of the batch released before the end of the year. \r\nThrowback\r\nWhen asked about the status of the backwards compatibility project by GameSpot, Spencer stated “We\'re close, we\'re really close.” \r\n“I have a little dashboard I go to and I can see all the games [and] where they are in getting approvals in the pipeline,” he continued. \r\n“I know the games that are coming for the original Xbox but I don\'t think we\'ve announced them all. We have to do this in partnership with partners, but we\'re still on track. I feel really good. The games look great.”\r\nBackwards compatibility on the Xbox One X will, apparently, work slightly differently to the Xbox One S. According to Spencer, Xbox has still to reveal some “interesting” details on how the feature will work on the upcoming 4K console but seems fairly certain that people will find it “interesting.”\r\nThere’s plenty of interest in original Xbox games coming to the latest consoles and although Spencer says that some of the games hold up better than others, we imagine the memories and nostalgia will more than make up for anything lacking in the visuals. \r\nThough we still don’t have an exact date for when this backwards compatibility extension will go live, we imagine Microsoft will wait until after the launch of the Xbox One X on November 7. Some time between this new console launch and Christmas would, arguably, make the most sense for the company. \r\nWe imagine original Xbox games coming to the Xbox One would tie in very neatly with the release of the revamped Duke controller which was also announced at E3 this year. Though this controller doesn’t have an exact release date, either, it’s also scheduled for before the end of 2017.', 'images/gam3.jpg'),

But with the move to HD and now 4K visuals, old games can be made to look even better than the original. We\'ve seen this with the HD upscaling included on the NES and SNES Classic, and now PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 has added support for up to 10K visuals.10K is still out of reach of, well, everyone for now, but the emulator update means playing games from the 11-year-old system\'s library can now be done in 4K with 16x anisotropic filtering enabled. That sounds great, but the results have to be seen to be believed. Luckily, RPCS3 took the time to create the video included below to demonstrate just how great PS3 games can look.\r\nThe majority of PS3 titles use a resolution of 1280-by-720, although some did managed 1920-by-1080. RPCS3 uses resolution scaling to increase the output with the theoretical maximum right now being 10K. However, more realistically the emulator will happily output at true 4K (3840-by-2160) by using a resolution scale of 300 percent on a 1280-by-720 game.\r\nOf course, to use RPCS3 with such high resolutions requires a good spec PC. The RPCS3 team state a dedicated graphics card with Vulkan support is all that\'s needed as most of the workload for the emulator is carried out by the CPU. The graphics card is untapped, and so it can be used for this 4K upscaling.\r\nThere is still a lot of work to be done to make RPCS3 a true alternative to PS3 hardware. Right now only 15 percent of PS3 games are marked as playable on the Compatibility List. But 15 percent of 1,438 games is still a lot of games to play while you wait for more to gain support.', 'images/gam4.png'),

In a career spanning over three decades, Yadav has been a part of six films that were sent for the Oscars, including Deepa Mehta’s Indo-Canadian film “Water”, Kalpana Lajmi- directed “Rudaali”, Shekar Kapur’s “Bandit Queen” and his latest film “Newton”. Two of his films, Mira Nair’s “Salaam Bombay” and Aamir Khan-starrer “Lagaan”, made it to the final Oscars nominations. In an interview with PTI, Yadav says, “I have never thought about or calculated these things as my entire focus is on giving my best as an actor.\r\nI don’t pay attention on a film going for Oscars, I feel if the film is good then it will get the love and recognition it deserves. “I do my work with utmost honesty and even the films that I did – ‘Salaam Bombay’, ‘Water’, ‘Lagaan’ and ‘Newton’ – were made with honesty.” The actor says he is particular about his choice of characters and prefers doing films that he believes will leave an impact on the audience.\r\n“If the film is good then it will go anywhere, be it the Oscars or any other award. When the script is good, one gets an idea that it will do well in every which way, be it commercially or in terms of awards and international recognition. The sensibility of a director matters the most.” The actor says he disagrees with a notion that commercial films are low on content and indie films are always good. “It is a wrong perception that commercial films cannot be good. They can be good if made with good intent. The films that I acted in and got nominated for Oscars were never made with the intention of making them commercial.\r\n \r\n“But at the same time, there are big-budget films that have not done well because the story was not good. For independent cinema too, it is not easy as these films also need to have good story to become a hit.” Directed by Amit Masurkar, “Newton” features Rajkummar Rao in the lead.

Polling for the election was necessitated by the demise of BJP leader and sitting MP, Khanna, who had represented Gurdaspur constituency in Lok Sabha earlier between 1998-2009 and 2014–2017.\r\nSingh, who had endorsed Jakhar\'s nomination for the party ticket, tweeted:\r\nUndoubtedly, it’s a big win for Congress, but it would be too early to write-off the prospects of BJP in the 2019 General Election to Lok Sabha as Opposition sees it. Especially since the party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had registered a landslide victory in 2014 Lok Sabha elections by winning 282 seats for BJP.\r\nRiding high on Sunday’s victory, the opponents have to hold their horses till 2019 before jumping to any conclusion.\r\nLet’s not forget, Congress won the Gurdaspur seat only after the demise of Khanna who had defeated the then sitting MP and Punjab state Congress president Pratap Singh Bajwa in 2014.\r\nAccording to the locals of Gurdaspur, the actor-turned-politician like his tall and robust personality had acted like a wall in protecting his constituency from the opponents. It was he who had cracked the Lok Sabha constituency Gurdaspur comprising nine Assembly segments — Pathankot, Dina Nagar, Qadian, Batala, Fatehgarh Churian, Dera Baba Nanak, Gurdaspur, Sujanpur and Bhoa — and once a Congress bastion, for BJP.\r\nDespite strong anti-Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and anti-Badal sentiments, Khanna had won the Gurdaspur seat. It was then anticipated that barring BJP, either Congress or Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would win. AAP had fielded its former state president Sucha Singh Chhotepur, who had strong chances to win, but all poll predictions failed in front of Khanna’s glam factor and public image.\r\nThis correspondent had the opportunity to cover the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in Punjab and in one of Khanna’s rallies in Gurdaspur, the moment the veteran actor appeared to address the public, voters requested him to narrate the lines from his 1971 superhit film Mera Gaon, Mera Desh — \"Jabbar Singh ne do baatein seekhi hain. Ek, mauke ka fayeda uthaana. Do, dushmano ko naash karna (Jabbar Singh has learnt two things in life. One, to take advantage of the situation. Two, to destroy enemies).\r\nAnd Khanna proved it during the polls by emerging a winner. It was his charismatic personality and the works he carried out in his constituency that went in favour of BJP. He was instrumental in building a dozen major and minor bridges on rivers Beas, Ravi and Ujh that connect Gurdaspur with the rest of Punjab and conducted medical camps to provide free heart surgeries for poor patients.\r\nThe loss of BJP in this bypoll has been more due to its ally SAD. During the previous Prakash Singh Badal regime, the drug menace grew exponentially in Gurdaspur, taking the form of a major social issue. The menace played an important role in turning the tide in favour of Congress, which saw Singh leading the party to power in the last Assembly polls.\r\nStrong anti-Badal sentiments, public anger against SAD especially in Gurdaspur due to the drug menace and absence of Khannas’s charisma have added to BJP’s loss in the bypoll.\r\n\"In Gurdaspur, we couldn’t think of anyone other than Khanna. In the 2014 General Election to Lok Sabha, besides his charisma, people voted him in large number as Modi was leading the election. We wanted both BJP under Modi and Khanna to win, and it happened. His absence has left a huge vacuum and it made it easier for Congress to win Gurdaspur seat. Moreover, now it’s Congress government in Punjab and people have lots of expectations from Singh,” Tejinder Singh Khalsa, a trader from Gurdaspur told Firstpost.\r\nPeople of Gurdaspur think that BJP needs a heavy-weight candidate, who can fill up Khanna’s vacuum in future. Even today, the voters of this constituency have strong memories of how the veteran Bollywood actor had got his public projects sanctioned from the then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and implemented them successfully.', 'images/politics1.jpg'),

In fact, for the first time in an Assembly by-election in Kerala, BJP\'s top national and state leaders campaigned for party candidate K Janachandran Master expecting the roadshow to spin more votes, if not a sure win.\r\nBut despite a high-voltage campaign, Master could muster only 5,728 of the 122,623 votes polled, which was less than its tally of 7,015 in 2016 and 5,952 votes that the party had managed from this segment in the recent Malappuram Lok Sabha by-election.\r\nEven more humiliating was the fact that the Social Democratic Party (SDPI), which is taking lessons from the hardline Hindutva politics that the BJP practises in Kerala, went away with more votes (8,648) mainly eating into the votes of KNA Khader, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate fielded by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML).\r\nA missed opportunity?\r\nHindus constitute around 25 percent of the electorate of the Muslim-dominated constituency but they too appeared to have given a cold shoulder to BJP harping on the “jihadi terror”.\r\nIts \"development\" slogan also failed to enthuse voters at large hit hard by the demonetisation fiasco. There was an increase of 1,590 in total votes polled this time, and the youngsters too seem to have ignored the Hindutva bandwagon.\r\nMany feel that BJP’s communally charged campaign helped the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in a big way to make inroads into the IUML vote bank, unleashing a communal campaign that Muslims would be safe only under its protection.\r\nEven some BJP supporters feel the party should stop Muslim bashing and instead engage with them constructively on issues like triple talaq and women empowerment and it should have fielded a non-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) candidate.\r\n\"I feel BJP committed a mistake in understanding the Muslim mind.

But I feel it lost a great opportunity to field a Muslim woman candidate and make a difference from others. It should have been a real experiment for the party that is trying to expand its base in Kerala.\"\r\nHowever, Haridas feels that the BJP’s anti-red and jihadi terror blitzkrieg with regular protest marches simultaneously on the AKG Bhavan and the CPM headquarters in the national capital is more targeted at the cowbelt than Kerala.\r\nMuslims constitute 26.58 percent and Christians 18.33 percent in Kerala. People of all faiths live together in harmony in the state\'s villages and towns and has no history of communal riots.\r\n\"I have been telling the party time and again that you cannot go ahead without taking minorities into confidence in Kerala,\" he told Firstpost.\r\n\"I perceive this as a failure on the part of BJP. It has a lot of opportunities in Kerala joining hands with all democratic forces against the Communist tyranny, which is not allowing any political opponents function freely.\"\r\nThe electoral setback would not affect the ongoing statewide roadshow, said Haridas, adding that BJP national president Amit Shah will join the marchers on Tuesday, when the show ends in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram.\r\nShah had earlier skipped a show of strength in Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan\'s village where many have fallen victims to revenge killings between the two groups, and speculations were rife that the BJP chief was upset with the poor response that the Yatra evoked.\r\nIt\'s UDF vs LDF\r\nAbdul Nasar, a voter who runs a furniture business in Vengara town, said both CPM and SDPI of the militant Popular Front of India (PFI) benefitted from the feeling of insecurity that the BJP campaign created among the Muslims.\r\nBoth parties used the alleged lynchings by cow vigilantes in northern parts of India to whip up passions and accused Congress and its allies of a soft-Hindutva approach while BJP leaders like Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who also participated in the Janaraksha Yatra only strengthened the perception.\r\nThe warning of IUML candidate, a Communist Party of India (CPI) leader who switched sides some years ago, against the Communist dictatorship, came handy for CPM.\r\nIn the process, PP Basheer, the CPM candidate, cornered 41,917 votes, improving on his 2016 tally of 33,275, while Khader could bag only 65,227 votes, despite a sharp increase in the turnout, far below 73,804 votes his predecessor PK Kunhalikutty got.', 'images/politics2.jpg'),

The obligation of any government is to respect and enforce the laws\".\r\n\r\n\"The political conflict did not begin as a cause of independence but as an exercise of irresponsibility that has been growing,\" she told the senate, admonishing the Catalan leader saying \"he has not lacked options for dialogue\". \r\n\r\nAhead of Puigdemont\'s announcement, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the Palace of the Government in Barcelona\'s Gothic quarter waiting to hear the Catalan leader speak.\r\n\r\nThey waved the Estelada, the one-starred Catalan flag used to represent an independent Catalan republic, and chanted \"Out! Out! Out! The Spanish flag!\" and other pro-independence slogans.', 'images/world3.jpg');

(80, 'Everything you need to know about Iceland\'s election', 'world', 'Reykjavik, Iceland - Iceland heads to the polls on Saturday with 10 parties on the ballot and amid a dark shadow of corruption. Here is everything you need to know:\r\nWhy is this election important?\r\n\r\nIn a word - corruption. Iceland is holding parliamentary elections for the second time in just under a year after the government collapsed in September, following a scandal by the governing Independence Party.\r\n\r\nThis follows close on the heels of the collapse of the government a year prior in 2016 when Iceland\'s then Prime Minister, Sigmundur Davio Gunnlaugsson of the Progressive Party, was the first political casualty from the fallout of the Panama Papers after it was revealed that he had been keeping a secret offshore bank account.\r\nWhat\'s at stake here?\r\n\r\nTackling corruption in government is again a leading force in the elections, as it was last year.\r\n\r\n\"Trust in the parliament and the system as a whole continues to be the deciding factor,\" says Oktavia Hrund Jonsdottir, who is running for the Pirate Party in East Reykjavik, \"without it efforts to form government will be difficult.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is unclear how public outrage at the latest scandal will translate at the voting booth. Most Icelandic voters are concerned with quality of life issues, particularly healthcare and the cost of housing.\r\n\r\nTourism is booming in Iceland, but the windfall has driven up the cost of living, and young Icelanders in Reykjavik can\'t afford to buy a home.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of natural resources, particularly fishing rights for the country\'s mainstay - cod - is also an important issue, as is ratifying the new constitution that was written five years ago, but remains to be adopted.\r\n\r\n\"Political corruption, including the blatant failure of parliament to ratify the new post-crash constitution, has trumped economic recovery in the minds of many voters,\" says Thorvaldur Gylfason, Professor of Economics at the University of Iceland.\r\n\r\n\"The strong opposition of the Independence Party to the new constitution, mainly to please its paymasters among the oligarchs in the fishing industry but also, more generally, to preserve the status quo across the board, frustrates many of their traditional voters.\r\n\r\n\"The Independence Party has become the face of Iceland\'s political corruption.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Independence Party loses this election, it will likely be viewed as a referendum on corruption. In this charged international political climate where every election is seen as a referendum on Trumpism, many will be watching which way Iceland goes.\r\nWhy should we care about Iceland?\r\n\r\nStrategically positioned between Europe and North America at the edge of the Arctic Circle, for a country of only 324,000 people with no army, Iceland often plays an outsized role on the world stage.\r\n\r\nIceland led the global economic collapse in 2008. It was a refuge for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange where he spent time working on WikiLeaks. It is a country that has seen several major corruption scandals in the past decade, including ties to Trump Soho through investments by the FL Group.\r\n\r\nIceland is also the oldest parliamentary system, dating back more than 1,000 years. The country is a world leader in women\'s rights, boasting the highest status of women of any country according to the World Economic Forum\'s gender gap index, and has the largest percentage of women in parliament of any country without a quota system - 48 percent.\r\n\r\nThe country has a strong environmental movement, running almost entirely on renewable energy, and a strong direct democracy movement. The constitution was re-written by crowdsourcing input from the public, and the young populist Pirate Party party has 15 percent of parliamentary seats.\r\nWhy did the government collapse?\r\n\r\nIn September the Bright Future party pulled out of a centre-right coalition government, forcing snap elections, after it was revealed that Benedikt Sveinsson, the father of the Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, had written to the Ministry of the Interior a letter of support to \"restore the honour\" of a convicted pedophile.\r\n\r\nThe entire affair, kept out of public sight, was uncovered by members of the Pirate Party and the Left-Greens after another controversial \"restoring the honour\" in a sexual abuse case gained public attention.\r\nHow does the vote work?\r\n\r\nIceland\'s Parliament, called the Althing, is comprised of 63 representatives who are elected from six provinces by proportional representation. Voting is done by paper ballot, avoiding the pitfalls of potential electronic vote hacking and fraud that the United States is now contending with. The election is set for Saturday, but voting has been open for several weeks in various locations.\r\n\r\nThe president of Iceland, Guoni Johannesson, who is elected in a separate voting process, gives the mandate to form a government typically to the party with the most votes. The centre-right Independence Party has led the Parliament for a great majority of the past 73 years that the country has been independent.\r\nWhy does the Independence Party keep winning?\r\n\r\nThat\'s the question many voters keep asking themselves.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s what people are familiar with\", or \"it\'s how their parents voted\", is how most people explain the steady support for the Independence Party.\r\n\r\nDuring the run-up to last year\'s parliamentary elections, international interest was piqued by the possibility that the Pirate Party would take over after they started polling far ahead of the pack. But the Pirates ended up finishing third behind the Independence Party and the Left-Greens, with 10 parliamentary seats.\r\n\r\nPresident Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson gave the mandate first to the Independence Party, then to the Left-Greens, then to the Pirates. All were unsuccessful in forming a coalition government. After three months, the Independence Party finally put together a coalition with the Bright Future and Reform parties.\r\nWho is going to win the elections?\r\n\r\nIcelanders often say everyone in Iceland is an artist or poet, and during this election cycle it feels like almost everyone is running for office. There are dozens of small parties across the country, and new ones form every year. There are 10 parties on the ballot for Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe question many Icelanders are asking themselves is not who will win, but who they should even vote for. And, of course, there are apps to help. One app, provided by RUV, the state TV channel, allows users to select answers to a series of questions about the issues, and then the app ranks which party the user most closely aligns with. The app has had more than 100,000 views.\r\n\r\nWhoever takes power will have a lot to contend with. Because of the snap elections, there is no budget yet for 2018, and a number of groups are planning to strike in reaction to the massive 40 percent pay rise that was handed down to MPs and government bureaucrats following last years elections.', 'images/world5.jpg');

While Lorenzo briefly took the lead on Lap 1, Marquez was quick to fight back and regain the lead. Dovizioso had a stunning start and quickly passed rivals to take P2, as Petrucci settled into third. In the opening stages itself, it was clear that these riders will be leading the race.\r\nAs the riders lapped the track, Marquez and Dovizioso moved further away from the rest of the lot, with Petrucci keeping close company. On Lap 12, Marquez made his first move to take the lead from Dovizioso, and all eyes were now on the two riders as a cat and mouse chase was what it seemed like with the pair changing positions. Marquez seemed clear in the lead fending consistent attacks from Dovizioso.\r\nBy the final lap, the sentiment echoed that of the Red Bull Ring fight from earlier this year between the title contenders.

(6, 'books', 'Man Booker prize 2017: from Abraham Lincoln to Brexit Britain', 'images/book1.jpg', 'What do book prizes have to do with serious literature? On the long view, the answer is: not much. Even the immensely distinguished Nobel prize, which has just delighted many British readers with its choice of Kazuo Ishiguro, has logged some pretty forgettable selections. Who, for instance, still reads Rudolf Christoph Eucken (1908), Karl Adolph Gjellerup (1917), Frans Eemil Sillanpää (1939) or Nelly Sachs (1966)?\r\nIn the arts, prizes will always be a lottery. Posh panels are just as vulnerable as the rest of us to the vagaries of taste. The joy of reading is that it’s free from the thought police. Books live and die in the hearts and minds of readers. Still, for close on 50 years, Man Booker’s quixotic efforts have made surprisingly good sense of a difficult, even impossible enterprise.\r\nTaste and judgment aside, the other intractable dimension of the Booker conundrum is its annual rendezvous with the marketplace. As in farming, or finance, there are good years and bad years. 2015 and 2016 were good years with excellent winners (Marlon James’s A Brief History of Seven Killings; Paul Beatty’s The Sellout).\r\nThis year, Booker’s panel is up against it. Before we discuss the shortlist, we have to note that, for whatever good reason, the judges decided to exclude some powerful contenders: Sebastian Barry (Days Without End), Arundhati Roy (The Ministry of Utmost Happiness), Zadie Smith (Swing Time) and, perhaps most surprising of all, Colson Whitehead (The Underground Railroad).\r\nWhen Lola Young, as chair, summarised the shortlist as “unique and intrepid books that collectively push against the borders of convention”, she articulated a mission statement for a final session that promises to be an excruciating visit to the third circle of a literary critical inferno.\r\nAutumn has everything one would want from a winner: humanity, brilliance and a kind of subversive ecstasy\r\nIn practical terms, Young and her team have to choose between three Americans, an English woman, an award-winning Scot and a Pakistani. Collectively, their novels have been described by one of the judges as “transcultural”, a word still new to many dictionaries.\r\nFirst on the shortlist is Paul Auster’s 4321 (Faber), a consciously epic, quasi-cubist portrait of an American boy’s life during the second half of the last century. (Full disclosure: I was Auster’s first publisher and have been an admirer of his work ever since The New York Trilogy.)\r\n4321 offers a hefty punch from an American heavyweight. At more than 1,000 pages, the multi-form versions of the life of Archibald Isaac Ferguson demonstrates a major writer at his best – original, ambitious, pitch-perfect and wholly absorbing. This is a novel tormented by fate, contingency and playful literary experimentation. But it’s also a narrative to get lost in, a Bildungsroman that is, by chance, a poignant elegy to the America that is being trashed by Trump and his vandals. 4321 must be a real contender.\r\nInevitably, Auster’s book towers over Emily Fridlund’s History of Wolves(Weidenfeld), an enigmatic coming-of-age novel set on the edge of a lake in the American midwest. Some readers may compare Fridlund’s book unfavourably with Marilynne Robinson’s Housekeeping, which is also set by a lake, but History of Wolves is grounded in a more sinister domestic narrative that grips the reader with a fierce vision of adolescent estrangement. It’s a powerful debut.\r\nFrom these all-American narratives, we move to Britain with Fiona Mozley’s Elmet (John Murray), another first novel about secrets in the family. As her title suggests, Mozley has drunk deep at the fount of Ted Hughes and has written a dark hymn to the landscape and language of Yorkshire that’s also, like Hughes’s poetry, bleak, lyrical and steeped in blood.\r\nWhere Mozley draws on an English tradition, in Exit West (Hamish Hamilton), Mohsin Hamid strikes a global dystopian note that’s fresh, contemporary and audacious, a love story set in a disintegrating society; a novel for the moment.\r\nWhich brings us to the big American challenger here, Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (Bloomsbury), the bookies’ favourite. Saunders has been extravagantly praised in the US for his short fiction, notably CivilWarLand in Bad Decline (1996), and is, unquestionably, a highly original talent who is taking fiction into extraordinary new territory. Lincoln in the Bardo, his first novel, is a strange and haunting reverie on Abraham Lincoln’s grief at the death of his 11-year-old son, Willie, “a small mirror of himself”, in 1862. The “bardo” is the Tibetan Buddhist limbo between death and rebirth in which Lincoln’s dead son meets ghostly voices from the past in a dazzling collage of voices.\r\nYou could describe this as a postmodern historical novel, but that would be to underestimate the thrill of Saunders’s intentions. Braiding snatches of prose, both original and archival, he redefines his chosen genre with some outrageous comic touches and many arresting moments of sheer magic. Experimental yet firmly anchored to its readers’ attention, it offers the kind of satisfactions typical of many previous winners. If it had not been so wildly acclaimed, it would seem a shoo-in for this year’s prize. And yet…\r\nThere is, from the final book on this list, Ali Smith’s Autumn (Penguin), some serious competition. Smith’s is another highly acclaimed performance, the first of a four-part series about time and the seasons. Autumn is a bittersweet tour de force set in “the worst of times” – Brexit Britain – and interweaving art, death and the mysteries of love. Smith’s portrait of centenarian Daniel Gluck, approaching death, and his passionate protege, Elisabeth, is a stunning exploration of memory and regret, a book that celebrates and entertains as much as it takes us into the twilight world of the dying. On some readings, Autumn has everything one would want from a winner: humanity, brilliance and a kind of subversive ecstasy.\r\nWho knows how the judges will adjudicate this list? Almost any outcome is possible on 17 October. Who knows if what they choose is literature? That’s for posterity. My hunch is that a US writer will take the prize again, no doubt stirring up more anti-Americanism, though Smith will have a lot of home support. You never can tell.\r\n'),

I well remember asking after His Dark Materials in a bookshop, back when the buzz was first building, and being directed to the children’s section. I assumed the person who’d recommended it had made a mistake and left empty-handed. But what a difference a few years make…\r\n\r\nIn art, as in life. La Belle Sauvage is a prequel – set 10 years or so before the events of Northern Lights. It reacquaints us with many of the characters from the original books. There are cameos from Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter, with her sinister beauty and her inscrutable monkey-daemon; we meet a younger version of the elderly Gyptian Farder Coram; and Pullman’s heroine Lyra is here too… except, rather than reading alethiometers and transforming the fortunes of the multiverse, this time her main role is to gurgle prettily and fill her nappy at inconvenient times. We all have to start somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe hero of this story, rather, is Malcolm, a boy on the verge of adolescence who helps out at his parents’ waterfront pub, the Trout, in the steampunk Oxford familiar from Northern Lights. His pride and joy is a canoe called La Belle Sauvage – and he takes a dim view of the acquaintance who thought it funny to scrawl out the V and replace it with an S. (You may, like me, develop a sneaking regard for this acquaintance.)\r\n\r\nThe plot gets going when, after witnessing a stranger dropping a secret message before being apprehended by a pair of thugs, Malcolm gets drawn into a world of politico-religious subterfuge. On one side are the theocratic fascists of the Magisterium – their sinister Stasi being the agents of the CCD (Consistorial Court of Discipline); on the other a shadowy resistance movement known as Oakley Street.\r\n\r\nAt issue, as ever, are the properties of Dust and the fate of baby Lyra, who is being semi-secretly sheltered by the nuns at the nearby priory. The surveillance state sends its roots deep. Echoing Morton Rhue’s minor classic The Wave, Malcolm’s school is taken over by a youth movement – the League of St Alexander – whose members are invited to inform on heretics and soon have the teachers terrified of their charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial and psychological commentary is seldom far from the surface. Like Milton, a quote from whom gave the His Dark Materials trilogy its title, Pullman has a design on the reader. Milton wanted to “justify the ways of God to man”; Pullman wants to do, roughly, the opposite – though his assault is less against an enfeebled Authority than the oppressive and obscurantist religions that claim to act in His Name.\r\n\r\nAnd like Tolkien, world-building is at least as much of a preoccupation as storytelling: over the first trilogy Pullman unfolded a whole existential set-up that mashed up the languages of magic and quantum physics to incorporate versions of the Many-Worlds hypothesis, a twisted-Milton creation mythos and, in Dust (also “dark matter”), a sort-of-materialist account of the Hard Problem of Consciousness. That’s quite some going for a children’s book.\r\n\r\nThis being a prequel, we can take the set-up – the workings of Dust and alethiometers and daemons and all that jazz – more or less as read, even if those revelations lie in the future for the characters in the book. Yet Pullman, generously, makes sure that you can come to this one fresh without having to read, or reread, what went before. The great metaphysical edifice of His Dark Materials is, for the most part, in the background.'),

That said, for approximately nine minutes, you may have minor concerns. Will this film merely coast on the cosy lovability that made its forebear (sorry) such a joy? How can the bar be nudged up, and who’s going to do it?\r\n\r\nEveryone’s favourite ursine Peruvian immigrant left his debut in such a warm and happy place, there’s a nagging lack of comic friction as we dive back in. The Brown family, living in their perfect multicultural haven of Windsor Gardens, are trying out some new eccentric hobbies, are they? Forgive us, makers of Paddington 2, for a light tapping of feet.\r\n\r\nImpatience is dispelled for good as the plot kicks in, and it turns out – with all due respect to returning leads Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins, not to mention Ben Whishaw’s cuddly vocal work – to be all about the guest stars. The first set-piece to get dear, disaster-prone Paddington spinning from the rafters involves a barbershop, a prone Tom Conti as a pompous judge, and a set of vibrating clippers. We start to feel in safe hands once again, but it takes this burst of skittering chaos to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd then Hugh Grant arrives. Essentially filling Nicole Kidman’s shoes as this instalment’s star villain, his role as a deliciously self-absorbed West End acting legend called Phoenix Buchanan is the gift that keeps on giving.\r\n\r\nThrough his machinations – it’s all to do with an antique pop-up book Paddington covets, which contains the clues, quite without him knowing, to a long-lost treasure stash – the poor bear is framed for robbery, and sentenced by a vindictive Conti to 10 years in jail.\r\n\r\nHis letters to beloved, 100-year-old Aunt Lucy suddenly have a mournful bent, though he does find time, by way of silver linings, to praise the prison’s imposing Victorian architecture and tip-top security.\r\n\r\nReturning director Paul King, in cahoots with new co-writer Simon Farnaby, proves that the crackpot inspiration that powered his first one was no fluke. Prison is exactly the place for Paddington, in the sense that his understated melancholy makes him seem even more adorable behind bars. The shadow of his outsider status returns, and there’s a whole new set of characters for him to win over with his quaint, flummoxed ways.'),
(11, 'business', 'Tata Tele deal: How Airtel is getting a billion-dollar business for free', 'images/business1.jpg', 'After Telenor ASA decided to hand over its India mobile business to Bharti Airtel Ltd for free, the Tata group has done the same. In the June quarter, revenues of these companies together stood at Rs3,202 crore, or nearly $2 billion on an annualized basis. Sure, since Tata’s non-mobile businesses, such as broadband, are being retained, the actual revenue that could potentially accrue to Airtel could be lower.\r\nStill, even using conservative estimates, the Tatas are transferring at least a $1 billion business to Airtel for free. Telenor’s annualized revenues stood at $606 million in the June quarter.\r\nIn fact, the Tatas have gone a step further compared to Telenor. For the latter, Airtel agreed to take over outstanding spectrum payments, other operational contracts such as tower leases and employees. But the deal with the Tatas is even sweeter; it will take over only a portion of outstanding spectrum payments and it’s not clear whether operational contracts and employees are part of the deal.\r\nThe simple reason Airtel is able to strike such deals is that it is the only buyer in the market. Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have enough on their plate with their own merger, and the last thing they would want to engage with is the integration of another telco. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, after having spent Rs2 trillion already in building its network, appears self-sufficient. Of course, these are also distress sales, given the high-cash burn at these companies. For sellers, therefore, one big hope is if Airtel evinces some interest. The only other option is to wind down the business, which entails far higher costs.\r\nA Tata Sons executive told Mint the cost of winding down the business would have been about Rs8,000 crore higher than the current arrangement. Knowing this well, Airtel has stayed shy of rushing into deals, and has waited till sellers agree to its terms.\r\nThis puts it in an enviable position; such takeovers help grow market share as well as help plug gaps in its spectrum portfolio at a fairly low cost. In addition, with Vodafone and Idea busy with the merger process, and given the uncertainty among their employees, Airtel can grab market share from its large rivals as well.\r\n'),

It will also us help reduce cost of funds by 3-4 per cent,\" IndusInd Bank managing director and chief executive Ramesh Sobti said.\r\nEarlier this afternoon, the boards of both the lenders separately decided on the merger and approved the share swap ratio wherein BFIL shareholders will get 639 shares of IndusInd for every 1,000 shares held.\r\nThe balance-sheet of BFIL, including the entire capital, assets and liabilities will move into IndusInd, while the operation team will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary and work as business correspondents.\r\nThe combined entity will have 40,000 employees, Sobti said, stating all the 15,000 employees of BFIL will be absorbed and continue in the same role. However, the board of the Hinduja Group promoted bank will remain unchanged.\r\nThe IndusInd scrip closed 0.43 per cent up at Rs 1,750.15 on the BSE on Friday, while BFIL shares closed 0.38 per cent up at Rs 1,003.45.\r\nSobti conceded that there is a 12-13 per cent premium over the average stock prices in the past two weeks which BFIL shareholders will get, but justified it on the Rs 9,500-crore loan book which his bank gets and also the synergies that will deliver higher value going forward.\r\nThe merger, expected to take up to 10 months to consummate, will help the bank in its rural play, where it has only 250 of its 1,210 branches, Sobti said.\r\nBFIL\'s network touches 1 lakh villages across the country and the merger will help it act as a full service bank rather than the monoline micro-loan provider, BFIL managing director and chief executive MR Rao said.\r\nIn the past few months, speculation has been strong about BFIL\'s suitor, especially after repeated attempts by the microlender which has survived multiple crises to turn into a small finance bank have failed. Many of its peers did manage to turn into the new-age entities.\r\nPH Ravi Kumar, non-executive chairman of BFIL, said the merger is not \"an easy one\" for the MFI and shared a trivia by stating that the announcement comes on the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Andhra MFI Act, which had led to doubts over the very survival of the sector.\r\nThis regulatory overreach had forced BFIL, floated by the high profile Vikram Akula as SKS Microfinance, and taken to a historic IPO in 2010 making it the first MFI to go public, to even change to its present name. The Andhra law left every player bleeding for a few years and forced RBI to bring the sector under its purview.\r\nBFIL feels only two areas of the banking segment -- the lower-middle class and those around poverty line --are the ones accretive to margins and when coupled with the full range of service offerings, the merger is a win-win.\r\nSobti elaborated saying that apart from reducing cost of funds, merger will help IndusInd not just achieve the priority sector lending sub-targets but also exceed them, making it a player in the PSL certificates market that is fee-accretive.\r\nBecause of the lower risk weights attached to lending by banks, it will help conserve capital as well, Sobti added, adding \"the merger is value accretive from day one.\"\r\nWhen asked about the structure of absorbing the balance sheet and keeping operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sobti said it is in sync with past precedents which have been cleared by the regulators and will also help maintain the ethos of the company.\r\nThe merger, which comes amid a surge in agri loan losses by banks, will increase share of micro loans to 7 per cent of the loan book of IndusInd from 2.8 per cent now, Sobti said, but will dip to 5 per cent over the next three years.\r\nAsserting that microloan segment is \"high yielding and has low delinquency rates\", Sobti said it will not lead to much troubles on the asset quality as BFIL has a 99.6 per cent repayment levels in this calendar year, after the note-bank hiccups stabilised.\r\nRao chipped in saying demonetisation led to a Rs 400- crore loan loss for BFIL, but it has been fully provided.\r\nThe deal will have to pass through a slew of regulators such as the Reserve Bank, National Company Law Board Tribunal and fair-play watchdog CCI.'),

From the four co-stars—Sonam Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania—preening in lehengas to dancing in sherwanis, the two looks have already got us placing bets on what can be expected from the film that’s set to release in May 2018.\r\n\r\nGiven that producer and stylist Rhea Kapoor and her fashion enthusiast/actor sister Sonam Kapoor have worked together on the project, it’s guaranteed to be a visual treat for style watchers. Designer duo Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla have created the costumes for the film and we couldn’t help but get on call with them for more insight on the wardrobe (and plot) details. Vogue spoke to one half of the designer duo, Sandeep Khosla, about what went into the making of Veere Di Wedding’s costumes.\r\n\r\nWhat did you have in mind when setting the tone for the movie via costumes?\r\nThe brief given to us was that it’s a chick flick in a way, but it’s also about emancipation of women. Rhea (Kapoor) was very clear that she wanted one look to be men’s sherwanis.\r\n\r\nWhat inspired you to try a vibrant palette of yellows, greens and tangerines for the first look?\r\nThe first poster is a bit of a tease—you can see the girls but you can’t really see them. The colour palette was our take on the marigold flower, which is also a part of the poster.\r\n\r\nTell us about your experience styling the four stars of the film. Any fun instances you encountered along the way?\r\nThe fittings have been a laugh riot. Going with the character and the mood, we have made some outfits sexier, some more covered. There are some corny clothes also!\r\n\r\nHow have you channeled each character’s personality via their clothes? What makes each character special?\r\nEach of the girls has a certain personality and Rhea was keen on bringing that in through the costumes. If somebody is a rebel, then it shows in their clothes.\r\n\r\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced as designers while working on Veere Di Wedding?\r\nNo challenges! The girls have been very supportive. They have really imbibed the vibe of their characters and the clothes and the whole experience of it. From whatever working stills I have seen of the movie—they all seem to be having a blast. Other than Sonam, we had never worked with Kareena, Swara or Shikha before. Kareena was more than happy to experiment different styles. Rhea really had a vision for the film and the thought process has come through. Originally, the plan was to go completely crazy with the fashion element of the film, but we made the brief a little more realistic.\r\n\r\nWhat palette have you relied on for this film?\r\nAs the film is about four girls bonding, we have got them in colour stories in places but otherwise they have independent styles. The clothes are not typical bridal clothes.\r\n\r\nThe second poster of Veere Di Wedding had all four stars looking sharp in co-ordinated sherwanis. Can a bride really step out in a sherwani?\r\nMaybe not the bride (laughs). But having your bridesmaids in sherwanis can be a really cool idea.\r\n\r\nWhat is your ultimate tip for Indian brides this season?\r\nMore and more brides are moving away from jadau jewellery and wearing diamonds, and white diamonds with red just looks awkward. We love the idea of fuchsia pink, yellow, pastels and even white for bridal lehengas.'),

Even when it tries to do the right thing, it often only manages to remind the world just how tone deaf it really is.\r\n\r\nTerry Richardson is a fashion and celebrity photographer who has worked with everyone from Beyonce and Miley Cyrus to Barack Obama. He is a skilled shooter, but one who has long had an extraordinarily sleazy reputation for being sexually abusive to models. In public, he\'s recognisable thanks to his signature style, which includes work shirts, long sideburns, a moustache and eyeglasses that give him the incongruous look of a nerdy pornographer.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, New York magazine published a profile of him detailing the often sordid nature of his work. While the story contained all the usual biographical data points and resume highlights, it also made it clear that Richardson was known for being an awful person who regularly coerced models into sexually compromising circumstances. At the time the story was published, there were still people willing to defend Richardson, who took pains to acknowledge his accomplishments as a photographer. But after it ran, the magazine published a follow-up that included the personal stories of models who alleged that Richardson had been a sexual bully and worse. Richardson, for his part, seemed to view himself as a somewhat tortured and unfairly maligned artist who sometimes happened to work nude.\r\n\r\nRichardson was mostly unscathed by the stories.\r\n\r\nNow, however, a certain mainstream segment of the fashion industry has decided to formally distance itself from him. The Daily Telegraph, London reported that in a leaked e-mail from Conde Nast International, the publishing house banned Richardson from working for the company\'s publications, which include such titles as Vogue and GQ. Any forthcoming photo shoots should be halted, the memo said. And any unpublished shoots pulled. (This does not mean that Richardson\'s work has been purged from the archives. Indeed, the GQ website still hosts \"The Best of Terry Richardson\" photo gallery.)\r\n\r\nThe facts of Richardson\'s behaviour have not changed over the last few years. Only the context. That roiling backdrop includes the denunciations of Harvey Weinstein and his predatory behaviour in and around Hollywood; the allegations of sexual harassment and cover-ups against Fox News\' Roger Ailes and Bill O\'Reilly; and the continued dismay by many that the current president once bragged on tape about groping women, has been accused of doing just that in real life, and hasn\'t yet faced any repercussions.'),

After yoga focus shifts to meditation', 'images/fit1.jpg', 'The demand for meditation is spreading across American cities -- perhaps a natural continuation of the yoga craze, which firmly embedded the search for nirvana in the health and wellbeing industry. It is 5 pm, otherwise known as rush hour in Manhattan. Julia Lyons, 31, finishes work and heads straight for her daily dose of peace and quiet -- half an hour at meditation studio “Mndfl.” Since April 2016, when she discovered the then-brand new studio, the investment bank employee has abandoned yoga and embraced meditation.\r\n“I have been meditating pretty regularly -- probably five times a week, 30-minute sessions,” says Lyons, sipping a cup of tea on the studio’s sofa. “I just need a moment to chill out. This city -- you are always running place to place and there are not a lot of quiet spaces,” she explains.\r\n“I think it’s made me a lot happier and also just helped me make better decisions, more thoughtful decisions.” Practiced by millions around the world, meditation promotes mental wellbeing through concentration, breathing techniques and self-awareness.\r\nFor a long time, those singing its praises were intellectuals, celebrities or people dedicated to spirituality. Its popularity in the West is owed in part to the Beatles, who promoted the practice on their return from India in the late 1960s.\r\nBut these days, meditation can be found in all areas of life -- from hospitals exploring its benefits for patients with serious illnesses, to schools who recommend it for children and television shows. The craze is a result of many factors -- waning attendance at places of worship, lives spent submerged in smartphones, not to mention neuroscientists’ confirmation of the benefits.\r\nAs a result, demand is spreading across American cities -- perhaps a natural continuation of the yoga craze, which firmly embedded the search for nirvana in the health and wellbeing industry.\r\nLodro Rinzler, Mndfl’s 34-year-old “chief spiritual officer,” opened his first studio in Greenwich Village at the end of 2015, and now owns two others in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Elsewhere in the US, studios can be found in Los Angeles, Miami, Washington and Boston.\r\nIntroduced to meditation as a child by his parents, who converted to Buddhism in the 1970s, he says business “is going well.” “The people who come here are really a cross section of all New Yorkers,” he explains. “If the common denominator is, ‘I am really stressed out, I need to know how to deal with my mind’ -- that’s basically everyone.”\r\nRinzler refuses to talk money, revealing only that classes are often full -- and the 75 numbered pads in his studios have been reserved online 70,000 times in just 18 months. The reason for success? A model offering a well-rounded introduction to this ancient practice for a reasonable price.\r\nFor years, Rinzler explains, Buddhist centers only offered long introductions -- sessions of several hours, or even seminars lasting a number of days and costing up to several thousand dollars.\r\nWith classes priced at just $10 for half an hour, and options for unlimited subscriptions, new studios in New York or Los Angeles hope to capture a wider audience. Their model is similar to gyms, but with “zen” in abundance -- including dimmed lights, plant walls, and unlimited organic tea.\r\n- CEOs join, employees follow -\r\nCompanies are also reaping meditation’s benefits. More and more organizations in Silicon Valley and other sectors are introducing employees to the practice, convinced of the long-term benefits for the workforce.\r\nEmily Fletcher, an ex-actress who has taught meditation since 2012, launched a special program for companies 18 months ago. Starting from 150 students in the first year, she now has over 7,000 -- and hopes to reach tens of thousands more with online courses, including in medium-sized cities such as Cleveland, Ohio or Tallahassee, Florida.\r\n“The most common way that I find myself teaching at companies is I teach the CEOs to meditate, and they start to benefit and they bring me on to do a talk with the company,” Fletcher, CEO of Ziva Meditation, says. Employees take part on a voluntary basis, mostly “for some selfish reasons,” the 38-year-old explains.\r\n“Either they want to speak better, please their boss, want to make more money or have better sex...”\r\nBut Fletcher insists she has no issue with people starting out of self-interest. “If you actually practice you will start enjoying your life more, your brain will function better, your body will feel better, you get sick less often,” she says. “Those altruistic things will happen as a result of the practice anyway.”\r\n- Mobile meditation -\r\nAnother aspect of the industry gaining traction is meditation apps. One of the most popular, Headspace, had already been downloaded more than 11 million times in the spring -- and boasts over 400,000 paying users.\r\nBut meditation’s newfound popularity is of such high intensity, neither Rinzler nor Fletcher is concerned about competing studios popping up over time.\r\n“I am sure they are going to be exactly like yoga studios, you are going to find them on every block...” Rinzler predicts. “If you look at it as a business, there is competition,” Fletcher reflects, adding, “if you see it as a mission, there are colleagues.”\r\n“There are not too many teachers when it comes to teaching four billion people in my lifetime!”\r\n'),

It could be the key to ageing well', 'images/fit2.jpg', 'Chinese and Canadian researchers have found evidence to suggest that a healthy gut could be linked to healthy ageing. Carried out by researchers from Ontario’s Western University and Lawson Health Research Institute as well as from Tianyi Health Science Institute in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China, the research is one of the largest microbiota studies conducted in humans, looking at a cohort of more than 1,000 Chinese participants. Previous research too has shown that gut bacteria can slow down ageing.\r\nThe researchers studied the gut bacteria in individuals, who were aged 3 to over 100 years old and self-reported as being “extremely healthy” with no known health problems and no family history of disease. The team observed a direct correlation between health and the microbes in the intestine, finding that the overall microbiota composition of the healthy elderly group was similar to that of people decades younger, with little difference between the gut microbiota of those age 30 to those age over 100.\r\n“This demonstrates that maintaining diversity of your gut as you age is a biomarker of healthy ageing, just like low-cholesterol is a biomarker of a healthy circulatory system,” commented Greg Gloor, the principal investigator on the study and also a professor at Western’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry and Scientist at Lawson Health Research Institute.\r\nThe study didn’t identify the cause or effect between gut microbiota and healthy ageing, with Gregor Reid, professor at Western’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry and Scientist at Lawson Health Research Institute saying, “It begs the question — if you can stay active and eat well, will you age better, or is healthy ageing predicated by the bacteria in your gut?”\r\nHowever, Gloor added that, “The main conclusion is that if you are ridiculously healthy and 90 years old, your gut microbiota is not that different from a healthy 30-year-old in the same population.” The researchers now suggest that resetting microbiota in the elderly to that of a 30-year-old might help promote health.\r\n“The aim is to bring novel microbiome diagnostic systems to populations, then use food and probiotics to try and improve biomarkers of health,” said Reid, adding, “By studying healthy people, we hope to know what we are striving for when people get sick.” The findings can be found published online in the journal mSphere.'),

At 14%, the proportion of children eating protein once a day is even lower, showed the survey by Podar Education Group which runs over 100 schools spread across the country.\r\nThe survey involved responses from 1,350 parents of children studying in grade six to 10 in India’s metro cities. The results showed that only 35% of children consume vegetables as part of every meal. “The World Health Organisation (WHO) does say that childhood obesity is an ‘exploding nightmare’ in the developing world,” said Raghav Podar, Trustee, Podar Education Group, in a statement.\r\nA new study led by Imperial College London and WHO and published in the journal Lancet showed that the number of obese children and adolescents (aged five to 19 years) worldwide has risen tenfold in the past four decades. “Healthy childhoods are critical to the country, and require strong cohesive work between the parents and schools,” Podar said.\r\nThe survey evaluating the eating habits across food categories in young school children in India also found that 50% of them consume junk food, sweets or other unhealthy food almost on a daily basis. “This survey clearly indicates that teaching a child about good nutrition is not just about giving them a list of healthy foods that he or she can eat, but more about ‘how much’ and ‘when’ to eat,” child nutritionist Sripriya Venkiteswaran said.\r\n“For example, teach them about age-appropriate portion sizes and how to limit themselves when they go out to birthday parties or buffet spreads. Teach them to eat at regular intervals, not skip meals and keep a gap of at least three hours between dinner and bed-time,” Venkiteswaran added.\r\nThe silver lining is that almost 76% of parents said that their kids play some outdoor sport. About 24% said their children do not play outdoors at all. “It is important for every child to have 60 minutes of moderately rigorous play every day to be fitter and healthier.

Warning of a “double burden” of malnutrition, researchers said the rate of increase in obesity far outstripped the decline in under-nutrition.\r\n“If post-2000 trends continue, child and adolescent obesity is expected to surpass moderate and severe underweight by 2022,” researchers wrote in The Lancet medical journal. The team found that there were 74 million obese boys aged 5-19 in 2016, up from six million four decades earlier.\r\nFor girls, the tally swelled from five million to 50 million. By comparison, there were 117 million underweight boys and 75 million underweight girls last year after the number peaked around the year 2000, the study said.\r\nAlmost two thirds of the underweight children lived in south Asia. Obesity ballooned in every region in the world, while the number of underweight children slowly decreased everywhere except south and southeast Asia, and central, east and west Africa.\r\nThe prevalence of underweight children decreased from 9.2 percent to 8.4 percent of girls aged 5-19 over the study period, and from 14.8 percent to 12.4 percent in boys. Obesity grew from 0.7 percent to 5.6 percent among girls and from 0.9 percent to 7.8 percent in boys.\r\nIn Nauru, the Cook Islands and Palau, more than 30 percent of children and teenagers were obese in 2016. In some countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Middle East, North Africa, the Caribbean and the United States, more than one in five children were obese.\r\n- Make healthy food affordable -\r\nExperts divide people into body mass categories calculated on the basis of their weight-to-height ratio. These range from underweight, normal weight, overweight and three categories of obese. Obesity comes with the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, while underweight children are more at risk from infectious diseases.\r\nChildren in either category can be stunted if their diet does not include healthy nutrients. “There is a continued need for policies that enhance food security in low-income countries and households, especially in south Asia,” said study author Majid Ezzati from Imperial College London.\r\n“But our data also shows that the transition from underweight to overweight and obesity can happen quickly in an unhealthy nutritional transition with an increase in nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods.” The team used the height and weight data of 129 million people older than five to estimate body mass trends for 200 countries from 1975 to 2016.\r\nWhile obesity in children and teens appears to have plateaued in rich countries, its rise continued in low- and middle-income countries, they found. “Very few policies and programmes attempt to make healthy foods such as whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables affordable to poor families,” Ezzati said in a statement. “Unaffordability of healthy food options to the poor can lead to social inequalities in obesity, and limit how much we can reduce its burden.”'),

Sipping warm -- not boiling hot -- drinks before and after meals helps prevent the loss of heat while also favouring digestion.

For those with nervous temperaments or who are quick to anger, sip on peppermint tea, which is stimulating but fresher.\r\n\r\n2) Eat orange\r\n\r\nTo load up on antioxidants and tasty flavours, tuck into topical vegetables. These seasonal stars are mostly yellow or orange in colour, and grow underground on the surface, like carrots, beetroot, parsnips, pumpkins, potatoes and sweet potatoes. Your gut will thank you for the soothing effect of these easy-to-digest veggies.

You might want to hear this out. Coffee is a natural dehydrator; and excess of it can leave you with a parched mouth which creates a favorable environment for the growth of oral bacteria. The dehydrating effect of coffee reduces the flow of saliva, which hinders the washing down of these oral bacteria. These bacteria then linger in your mouth for long and cause bad breath. Drinking water after short spurts of time can help wash down these bacteria and cut down the foul smell significantly. \r\n\r\n4. Tuna\r\n\r\n Fish, especially the protein packed Tuna, have long been associated with bad breath. Seafood starts smelling sour and foul with time as it reacts with the acid present in the mouth. You can pop a mint gum or tablet right after your meal or slash some vinegar on the fish before digging in, this prevents the oxidized odour. \r\n\r\n5. Dairy\r\n\r\nA tall glass of milk may do wonders for your body and overall health but excess of it may leave you with bad oral odour. The naturally occurring bacteria around the tongue feed on the amino acids found in milk and cheese, which can result in a foul smell from the mouth. But that doesn’t mean you toss milk or other dairy from your diet completely. Follow it up with a glass or two of water and your breath is back to smelling fine. \r\n\r\nYou need not eliminate these foods from your diet, with a  little moderation and a little caution you can avoid bad breath. Rinsing your mouth after every meal is an age-old advise that we must practice throughout our lives.

(33, 'food', '5 Herbal Teas to Calm Your Mind and Relieve Stress', 'images/food3.jpg', 'We can already feel a slight nip in the air and when the breeze becomes chilly – all we can think of is to curl up with a hot cup of tea. A perfect cup of tea can stimulate your senses and energize you from within. While yoga and meditation are known as effective ways to calm you mind and relive stress, some of the simplest pleasures in life may also have the same positive impact such as listening to music or sipping some soothing tea. Herbal teas not only relax your mind but also help you sleep peacefully.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Anju Sood, a Bangalore-based Nutritionist, “Herbal teas are very relaxing for mind as they contain essential oils that are known to cool down the nerve. Conventionally, 3 tablespoon of the fresh herbs or 1 tablespoon of dried herbs steeped in a cup of water for about 5 to 10 minutes should be enough.”\r\n\r\nWhat makes herbal teas so relaxing?\r\n\r\nCertain herbal teas may have an immediate effect in reducing anxiety. They are exposed to minimum oxidation during the processing of freshly plucked leaves of the tea plant, and they are known to have some magical properties that help in relaxing your body and mind. The key ingredient in herbal tea that leads to a state of physical and mental relaxation is a chemical known as L-theanine which helps in reducing stress, improves the quality the sleep, diminishes the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, heightens mental activity and reduces the negative side-effects of caffeine. Here are five herbal teas that will be your best companions during gloomy winter days.\r\n\r\n1. Chamomile Tea\r\nDelicate chamomile flowers are infused in hot water to make this tea that is known to help with stress relief and provides a good night’s sleep. You may use fresh or dried chamomile flowers to make this tea. Chamomile has a very soothing effect with mildly sedative properties that help you switch off on a hectic day.\r\n\r\n2. Peppermint Tea\r\nAromatic peppermint tea is known to be a great remedy for stomach problems like indigestion and even cold and flu. People often sip on peppermint tea after dinner to calm down the digestive system which helps you sleep better.\r\n\r\n3. Kahwa\r\nKahwa is a traditional beverage which is made with a mix of Kashmiri green tea leaves, whole spices, nuts and saffron. It is rich in antioxidants, helps you feel relaxed and reduces anxiety levels. It also helps to fight the negative effects of stress induced toxins in the body. It has a rich flavour and aroma.\r\n\r\n4. Sage Tea\r\nSage herb is known to be an excellent muscle relaxer. Sage is a wonderful remedy to rely on when you’re suffering from mental exhaustion and body ache. It makes for an enjoyable drink.\r\n\r\n5. Rose Tea\r\nThe sweet smell of roses is enough to beat stress and relax your mind. You can use fresh or dried rose petals and let them steep in water till they turn dark. Sip on it before going to bed. It has a calming effect on your mind which will help you sleep better.'),

The Flexitarian Diet is more about making a conscious decision to move away from a meat-heavy diet and embrace eating habits that include more of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes and lentils. With a growing body of medical evidence swinging in the favour of a vegetarian diet, the Flexitarian Diet allows one to have the best of both worlds. Practitioners of this diet gradually make a shift away from a diet rich in meats and other animal produce and include more of vegetarian and plant-based ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nUndeniably, our contemporary diets are loaded with simple carbohydrates, refined and processed items and animal products. Fruits, veggies, legumes, beans and lentils are fast disappearing from an average Indian plate - this aptly points at the growing incident of rampant nutrient deficiencies like protein, iron and vitamin D among others.\r\n\r\nSimply put, the term \'flexitarian\' stands for a diet of a person who is flexible in his/her dietary approach. Remember, the diet does not aim to turn you into a vegetarian but to gradually reduce your dependence on animal products and make you consume more plant-based foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to practice Flexitarianism\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #1 - Make it a point to include more veggies in your diet. Load up on whole grains, legumes, beans, lentils.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #2 - Start cutting down on meat simultaneously; if you are used to consuming meat or animal products in most of your meals, go meatless completely during lunch or dinner. Gradually observe meatless days if you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #3 - Consume less of red meat; processed meats should be avoided completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nRule #4 - Create a diet plan that is sustainable, eco-friendly, long-lasting - the one that promotes good health without having you to compromise on your dietary preferences.\r\n\r\nFlexitarianism is for those who want to take a step to adopt a healthier diet. It is specifically addressed to those who are mindful of the growing amount of meat and animal products in their daily diets and the associated threats to human health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Flexitarian is the combination of two words: Flexible + Vegetarian. It is a new way to eat that minimises meat without excluding it altogether. You get the health benefits of a vegetarian diet without having to follow the strict rules,\" writes Dawn Jackson Blatner, an American registered dietitian and the author of \'The Flexitarian Diet\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlatner describes her approach divided into three levels mentioned below:\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginner: 2 meatless days per week (26 ounces/730gms of meat or poultry per week)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced: 3-4 meatless days per week (18 ounces/510 gms of meat or poultry per week)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpert: 5 meatless days per week (9 ounces/255gms of meat or poultry per week)\r\n\r\n\"I\'d been a vegetarian for over 10 years but ate meat on rare occasions. Every time I ate meat I felt like I was being a bad, lazy vegetarian. So I developed this style of eating for people who know that vegetarianism is one of the healthiest and smartest ways to eat, but don\'t want to sit in the corner at a BBQ with an empty bun. The diet does not take foods away but instead adds new foods to those you already eat,\" she mentions on her official website.\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth experts, fitness enthusiasts, dieticians and nutritionists have their own take on the diet. While one approach would allow you to include meat in any one meal of the day, another would have you aim at going totally meatless twice a week, gradually taking it to not consuming meat on five out of seven days a week. The only thumb rule of the diet is to avoid as much of processed and red meat as possible and consume more of plant-based items than you did earlier.\r\n\r\nHere, animal products refer to non-vegetarian items and not dairy.');

It could also significantly reduce worldwide animal feed costs.\r\n\r\n\"We improved the nutritional value of corn, the largest commodity crop grown on Earth,\" said Thomas Leustek, study co-author and professor in the Department of Plant Biology in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. \"Most corn is used for animal feed, but it lacks methionine -- a key amino acid -- and we found an effective way to add it.\"\r\n\r\nThe study, led by Jose Planta, a doctoral student at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, was published online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nMethionine, found in meat, is one of the nine essential amino acids that humans get from food, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. It is needed for growth and tissue repair, improves the tone and flexibility of skin and hair, and strengthens nails. The sulfur in methionine protects cells from pollutants, slows cell aging and is essential for absorbing selenium and zinc.\r\n\r\nEvery year, synthetic methionine worth several billion dollars is added to field corn seed, which lacks the substance in nature, said study senior author Joachim Messing, a professor who directs the Waksman Institute of Microbiology. The other co-author is Xiaoli Xiang of the Rutgers Department of Plant Biology and Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China.\r\n\r\n\"It is a costly, energy-consuming process,\" said Messing, whose lab collaborated with Leustek\'s lab for this study. \"Methionine is added because animals won\'t grow without it. In many developing countries where corn is a staple, methionine is also important for people, especially children. It\'s vital nutrition, like a vitamin.\"\r\n\r\nChicken feed is usually prepared as a corn-soybean mixture, and methionine is the sole essential sulfur-containing amino acid that\'s missing, the study says.\r\n\r\nThe Rutgers scientists inserted an E. coli bacterial gene into the corn plant\'s genome and grew several generations of corn. The E. coli enzyme -- 3?-phosphoadenosine-5?-phosphosulfate reductase (EcPAPR) -- spurred methionine production in just the plant\'s leaves instead of the entire plant to avoid the accumulation of toxic byproducts, Leustek said. As a result, methionine in corn kernels increased by 57 percent, the study says.\r\n\r\nThen the scientists conducted a chicken feeding trial at Rutgers and showed that the genetically engineered corn was nutritious for them, Messing said.\r\n\r\n\"To our surprise, one important outcome was that corn plant growth was not affected,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn the developed world, including the U.S., meat proteins generally have lots of methionine, Leustek said. But in the developing world, subsistence farmers grow corn for their family\'s consumption.\r\n\r\n\"Our study shows that they wouldn\'t have to purchase methionine supplements or expensive foods that have higher methionine,\" he said.'),

(37, 'gaming', 'Middle-earth: Shadow Of War Graphics Settings Guide And PC Performance Tips', 'images/3301667-sowbenchmark.jpg', 'Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor was a marquee game for benchmarking PCs back in 2014 with its expansive environments and chaotic action sequences. The recently released sequel, Shadow of War, follows suit, and we figured this new adventure into Mordor is ripe for a quick graphics settings guide with some performance tips. It\'s an open-world action game, so twitch reactions and precision aiming aren\'t really part of the equation. It\'s not exactly necessary to maintain 60+ frames-per-second (FPS), but of course you want a smooth experience with as much eye candy as possible. Shadow of War\'s System Requirements  The game uses Monolith\'s own Firebird graphics engine (formerly known as LithTech), and despite having large, detailed environments, the system requirements aren\'t too demanding. However, for a more optimal experience on PC, the recommended specs provide more than enough juice as you\'ll see in our results.  Minimum requirements:      CPU: Intel Core i5-2300 / AMD FX-4350     GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 / AMD HD 7870     Memory: 6 GB RAM     Disk Space: 70 GB  Recommended:      CPU: Intel Core i7-3770 / AMD FX-8350     GPU: Nvidia GTX 970 or 1060 / AMD RX 480 or 580     Memory: 12 GB RAM  For the purposes of our tests, we\'re using a mid-range system that closely represents the recommended specs for the game. Our PC includes an Intel Core i5-3570K CPU, MSI GTX 970 GPU, and 8GB of RAM. A Look At Our Graphics Options  Let\'s take a quick look at our options. We\'re sticking with 1080p for our resolution, but there are more than enough choices here, even allowing you to try 8K (7680x4320). V-Sync helps prevent screen tearing, although we prefer to keep it off. Dynamic resolution helps maintain consistent performance by adapting resolution in real time to how demanding the game gets; you can set the floor for how low the resolution goes.  While Shadow Of War has six graphical quality presets, we\'re going custom here. Lighting, Shadows, Mesh qualities are all set to High. Texture quality is also set to High since Ultra is specifically for the 4K texture pack and requires a video card with at least 8GB of video memory. Tessellation adds more three-dimensional detail to surfaces based on mapping data; we kept this on for more visual flair. Depth of Field is an effect that blurs areas that aren\'t at the focus of the player, and you should set this to your preference. The game doesn\'t specify what type of ambient occlusion techniques it uses outright, but we found Medium to be a good balance between performance and visual quality with our specs. For anti-aliasing, we used TAA (temporal anti-aliasing). It\'s an increasingly popular technique to get rid of jaggies, since it hits a nice balance of quality and performance. You\'ll definitely want this on over FXAA (fast approximate anti-aliasing), which tends to look too blurry. Texture filtering should be set to Ultra; this basically means anisotropic filtering is set to 16x.  Shadow of War does a great job of showing you what\'s going behind these graphics settings. Not only does the game explain what each setting does, but it gives you a breakdown of how the settings affect system memory and VRAM consumption. It even provides you with a neat little benchmark tool to get specific frame-time readings and FPS results through a 60-second fly by of an in-engine sequence, which is how we tested our systems. Running On Recommended Specs  With our modest system close to the recommended specs and aforementioned choices in graphics settings, the benchmark results showed an average of 71 FPS. It hit a minimum of 41 FPS but just for a brief moment it got as high as 96 FPS. For the most part, the live FPS readings were consistently between the mid-60s to mid-70s. This gives you a little wiggle room if you want to bump a few other options up a notch. Verdict  There were slight hitches during normal gameplay, but they were few and far between and inconsequential to the game\'s action in our experience. Visually, the game looks a little flat overall, but the PC version of Middle-earth: Shadow of War runs exceptionally well, even on modest hardware. But we were also reminded that 60 FPS at 4K resolution with the highest visual quality in modern games is still tough to attain unless you\'re willing the shell out the big bucks for the best video card available.'),

However, in a recent interview with GameSpot, Xbox head Phil Spencer did say we’d see the first of the batch released before the end of the year. \r\nThrowback\r\nWhen asked about the status of the backwards compatibility project by GameSpot, Spencer stated “We\'re close, we\'re really close.” \r\n“I have a little dashboard I go to and I can see all the games [and] where they are in getting approvals in the pipeline,” he continued. \r\n“I know the games that are coming for the original Xbox but I don\'t think we\'ve announced them all. We have to do this in partnership with partners, but we\'re still on track. I feel really good. The games look great.”\r\nBackwards compatibility on the Xbox One X will, apparently, work slightly differently to the Xbox One S. According to Spencer, Xbox has still to reveal some “interesting” details on how the feature will work on the upcoming 4K console but seems fairly certain that people will find it “interesting.”\r\nThere’s plenty of interest in original Xbox games coming to the latest consoles and although Spencer says that some of the games hold up better than others, we imagine the memories and nostalgia will more than make up for anything lacking in the visuals. \r\nThough we still don’t have an exact date for when this backwards compatibility extension will go live, we imagine Microsoft will wait until after the launch of the Xbox One X on November 7. Some time between this new console launch and Christmas would, arguably, make the most sense for the company. \r\nWe imagine original Xbox games coming to the Xbox One would tie in very neatly with the release of the revamped Duke controller which was also announced at E3 this year. Though this controller doesn’t have an exact release date, either, it’s also scheduled for before the end of 2017.'),

But with the move to HD and now 4K visuals, old games can be made to look even better than the original. We\'ve seen this with the HD upscaling included on the NES and SNES Classic, and now PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 has added support for up to 10K visuals.10K is still out of reach of, well, everyone for now, but the emulator update means playing games from the 11-year-old system\'s library can now be done in 4K with 16x anisotropic filtering enabled. That sounds great, but the results have to be seen to be believed. Luckily, RPCS3 took the time to create the video included below to demonstrate just how great PS3 games can look.\r\nThe majority of PS3 titles use a resolution of 1280-by-720, although some did managed 1920-by-1080. RPCS3 uses resolution scaling to increase the output with the theoretical maximum right now being 10K. However, more realistically the emulator will happily output at true 4K (3840-by-2160) by using a resolution scale of 300 percent on a 1280-by-720 game.\r\nOf course, to use RPCS3 with such high resolutions requires a good spec PC. The RPCS3 team state a dedicated graphics card with Vulkan support is all that\'s needed as most of the workload for the emulator is carried out by the CPU. The graphics card is untapped, and so it can be used for this 4K upscaling.\r\nThere is still a lot of work to be done to make RPCS3 a true alternative to PS3 hardware. Right now only 15 percent of PS3 games are marked as playable on the Compatibility List. But 15 percent of 1,438 games is still a lot of games to play while you wait for more to gain support.'),

Polling for the election was necessitated by the demise of BJP leader and sitting MP, Khanna, who had represented Gurdaspur constituency in Lok Sabha earlier between 1998-2009 and 2014–2017.\r\nSingh, who had endorsed Jakhar\'s nomination for the party ticket, tweeted:\r\nUndoubtedly, it’s a big win for Congress, but it would be too early to write-off the prospects of BJP in the 2019 General Election to Lok Sabha as Opposition sees it. Especially since the party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had registered a landslide victory in 2014 Lok Sabha elections by winning 282 seats for BJP.\r\nRiding high on Sunday’s victory, the opponents have to hold their horses till 2019 before jumping to any conclusion.\r\nLet’s not forget, Congress won the Gurdaspur seat only after the demise of Khanna who had defeated the then sitting MP and Punjab state Congress president Pratap Singh Bajwa in 2014.\r\nAccording to the locals of Gurdaspur, the actor-turned-politician like his tall and robust personality had acted like a wall in protecting his constituency from the opponents. It was he who had cracked the Lok Sabha constituency Gurdaspur comprising nine Assembly segments — Pathankot, Dina Nagar, Qadian, Batala, Fatehgarh Churian, Dera Baba Nanak, Gurdaspur, Sujanpur and Bhoa — and once a Congress bastion, for BJP.\r\nDespite strong anti-Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and anti-Badal sentiments, Khanna had won the Gurdaspur seat. It was then anticipated that barring BJP, either Congress or Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would win. AAP had fielded its former state president Sucha Singh Chhotepur, who had strong chances to win, but all poll predictions failed in front of Khanna’s glam factor and public image.\r\nThis correspondent had the opportunity to cover the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in Punjab and in one of Khanna’s rallies in Gurdaspur, the moment the veteran actor appeared to address the public, voters requested him to narrate the lines from his 1971 superhit film Mera Gaon, Mera Desh — \"Jabbar Singh ne do baatein seekhi hain. Ek, mauke ka fayeda uthaana. Do, dushmano ko naash karna (Jabbar Singh has learnt two things in life. One, to take advantage of the situation. Two, to destroy enemies).\r\nAnd Khanna proved it during the polls by emerging a winner. It was his charismatic personality and the works he carried out in his constituency that went in favour of BJP. He was instrumental in building a dozen major and minor bridges on rivers Beas, Ravi and Ujh that connect Gurdaspur with the rest of Punjab and conducted medical camps to provide free heart surgeries for poor patients.\r\nThe loss of BJP in this bypoll has been more due to its ally SAD. During the previous Prakash Singh Badal regime, the drug menace grew exponentially in Gurdaspur, taking the form of a major social issue. The menace played an important role in turning the tide in favour of Congress, which saw Singh leading the party to power in the last Assembly polls.\r\n'),

In fact, for the first time in an Assembly by-election in Kerala, BJP\'s top national and state leaders campaigned for party candidate K Janachandran Master expecting the roadshow to spin more votes, if not a sure win.\r\nBut despite a high-voltage campaign, Master could muster only 5,728 of the 122,623 votes polled, which was less than its tally of 7,015 in 2016 and 5,952 votes that the party had managed from this segment in the recent Malappuram Lok Sabha by-election.\r\nEven more humiliating was the fact that the Social Democratic Party (SDPI), which is taking lessons from the hardline Hindutva politics that the BJP practises in Kerala, went away with more votes (8,648) mainly eating into the votes of KNA Khader, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate fielded by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML).\r\nA missed opportunity?\r\nHindus constitute around 25 percent of the electorate of the Muslim-dominated constituency but they too appeared to have given a cold shoulder to BJP harping on the “jihadi terror”.\r\nIts \"development\" slogan also failed to enthuse voters at large hit hard by the demonetisation fiasco. There was an increase of 1,590 in total votes polled this time, and the youngsters too seem to have ignored the Hindutva bandwagon.\r\nMany feel that BJP’s communally charged campaign helped the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in a big way to make inroads into the IUML vote bank, unleashing a communal campaign that Muslims would be safe only under its protection.\r\nEven some BJP supporters feel the party should stop Muslim bashing and instead engage with them constructively on issues like triple talaq and women empowerment and it should have fielded a non-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) candidate.\r\n\"I feel BJP committed a mistake in understanding the Muslim mind.

It should have been a real experiment for the party that is trying to expand its base in Kerala.\"\r\nHowever, Haridas feels that the BJP’s anti-red and jihadi terror blitzkrieg with regular protest marches simultaneously on the AKG Bhavan and the CPM headquarters in the national capital is more targeted at the cowbelt than Kerala.\r\nMuslims constitute 26.58 percent and Christians 18.33 percent in Kerala. People of all faiths live together in harmony in the state\'s villages and towns and has no history of communal riots.\r\n\"I have been telling the party time and again that you cannot go ahead without taking minorities into confidence in Kerala,\" he told Firstpost.\r\n\"I perceive this as a failure on the part of BJP. It has a lot of opportunities in Kerala joining hands with all democratic forces against the Communist tyranny, which is not allowing any political opponents function freely.\"\r\nThe electoral setback would not affect the ongoing statewide roadshow, said Haridas, adding that BJP national president Amit Shah will join the marchers on Tuesday, when the show ends in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram.\r\nShah had earlier skipped a show of strength in Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan\'s village where many have fallen victims to revenge killings between the two groups, and speculations were rife that the BJP chief was upset with the poor response that the Yatra evoked.\r\nIt\'s UDF vs LDF\r\nAbdul Nasar, a voter who runs a furniture business in Vengara town, said both CPM and SDPI of the militant Popular Front of India (PFI) benefitted from the feeling of insecurity that the BJP campaign created among the Muslims.\r\nBoth parties used the alleged lynchings by cow vigilantes in northern parts of India to whip up passions and accused Congress and its allies of a soft-Hindutva approach while BJP leaders like Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who also participated in the Janaraksha Yatra only strengthened the perception.\r\nThe warning of IUML candidate, a Communist Party of India (CPI) leader who switched sides some years ago, against the Communist dictatorship, came handy for CPM.\r\nIn the process, PP Basheer, the CPM candidate, cornered 41,917 votes, improving on his 2016 tally of 33,275, while Khader could bag only 65,227 votes, despite a sharp increase in the turnout, far below 73,804 votes his predecessor PK Kunhalikutty got.'),

More observations from other telescopes around the world suggest the object’s trajectory is at an unusually steep angle to the plane on which all the planets lie, and it does not orbit the sun. A/2017 U1’s slingshot route suggests it is a recent visitor to the solar system — and is now on its way out again. The discovery was announced in a bulletin published October 25 by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center.  \r\n\r\nAll asteroids previously seen come from within the solar system and circle the sun. Even comets, which come from a distant reservoir of icy rocks in the solar system called the Oort cloud and can have highly titled orbits, still orbit the sun.\r\n\r\nAstronomers first pegged the object as a comet thanks to its elongated path, but additional telescope observations October 25 indicate it’s more likely that A/2017 U1 is an asteroid. Those observations revealed that the object looked like a single, sharp point of light, suggesting it is not a comet, which would have an extended icy halo. The asteroid is probably no more than 400 meters across and is zooming through the solar system at 25.5 kilometers per second.\r\n\r\nThe new data also supported the wacky trajectory, suggesting the object truly is a visitor from beyond. “It’s now looking very promising,” says planetary scientist Michele Bannister of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, although she would still like to get more data to be sure.

The toll, however, has been heavy: At least 40 dead, more than 5,000 homes, businesses and other buildings destroyed.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy heads a minority government and needs the support of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) to enact Article 155.\r\n\r\nA PSOE spokesperson had previously said that if Puigdemont called elections, triggering Article 155 would not be necessary.\r\n\r\nEarlier, reports had suggested that Puigdemont would announce a snap regional election, in what was seen as a plan to foil Madrid\'s plan to take direct control of Catalonia.\r\n\r\nThe elections were one of three options \"on the table\" for Puigdemont, according to Carme Forcadell, president of the Catalan Parliament.\r\n\r\nThese included a declaration of independence, a declaration of independence with subsequent elections, or elections without independence.\r\n\r\n\'Exercise of irresponsibility\'\r\n\r\nCatalans voted in a disputed independence referendum on October 1 that was ruled illegal by the Spanish Constitutional Court and met with police violence, which was condemned by rights groups and European leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Catalan government said 90 percent voted for independence, but turnout was less than 50 percent.\r\n\r\nPuigdemont announced independence on October 10, but suspended the declaration after eight seconds to encourage dialogue with Madrid.\r\n\r\nNo dialogue is known to have taken place. \r\n\r\nFollowing Puigdemont\'s announcement, Spanish Vice President Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said she regretted that Puigdemont had decided not to go to the Senate \"to argue against Article 155\".\r\n\r\nShe told the parliament must \"comply with a legal, democratic and legal obligation. The obligation of any government is to respect and enforce the laws\".\r\n\r\n\"The political conflict did not begin as a cause of independence but as an exercise of irresponsibility that has been growing,\" she told the senate, admonishing the Catalan leader saying \"he has not lacked options for dialogue\". \r\n\r\nAhead of Puigdemont\'s announcement, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the Palace of the Government in Barcelona\'s Gothic quarter waiting to hear the Catalan leader speak.\r\n\r\nThey waved the Estelada, the one-starred Catalan flag used to represent an independent Catalan republic, and chanted \"Out!

(80, 'world', 'Everything you need to know about Iceland\'s election', 'images/world5.jpg', 'Reykjavik, Iceland - Iceland heads to the polls on Saturday with 10 parties on the ballot and amid a dark shadow of corruption. Here is everything you need to know:\r\nWhy is this election important?\r\n\r\nIn a word - corruption. Iceland is holding parliamentary elections for the second time in just under a year after the government collapsed in September, following a scandal by the governing Independence Party.\r\n\r\nThis follows close on the heels of the collapse of the government a year prior in 2016 when Iceland\'s then Prime Minister, Sigmundur Davio Gunnlaugsson of the Progressive Party, was the first political casualty from the fallout of the Panama Papers after it was revealed that he had been keeping a secret offshore bank account.\r\nWhat\'s at stake here?\r\n\r\nTackling corruption in government is again a leading force in the elections, as it was last year.\r\n\r\n\"Trust in the parliament and the system as a whole continues to be the deciding factor,\" says Oktavia Hrund Jonsdottir, who is running for the Pirate Party in East Reykjavik, \"without it efforts to form government will be difficult.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is unclear how public outrage at the latest scandal will translate at the voting booth. Most Icelandic voters are concerned with quality of life issues, particularly healthcare and the cost of housing.\r\n\r\nTourism is booming in Iceland, but the windfall has driven up the cost of living, and young Icelanders in Reykjavik can\'t afford to buy a home.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of natural resources, particularly fishing rights for the country\'s mainstay - cod - is also an important issue, as is ratifying the new constitution that was written five years ago, but remains to be adopted.\r\n\r\n\"Political corruption, including the blatant failure of parliament to ratify the new post-crash constitution, has trumped economic recovery in the minds of many voters,\" says Thorvaldur Gylfason, Professor of Economics at the University of Iceland.\r\n\r\n\"The strong opposition of the Independence Party to the new constitution, mainly to please its paymasters among the oligarchs in the fishing industry but also, more generally, to preserve the status quo across the board, frustrates many of their traditional voters.\r\n\r\n\"The Independence Party has become the face of Iceland\'s political corruption.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Independence Party loses this election, it will likely be viewed as a referendum on corruption. In this charged international political climate where every election is seen as a referendum on Trumpism, many will be watching which way Iceland goes.\r\nWhy should we care about Iceland?\r\n\r\nStrategically positioned between Europe and North America at the edge of the Arctic Circle, for a country of only 324,000 people with no army, Iceland often plays an outsized role on the world stage.\r\n\r\nIceland led the global economic collapse in 2008. It was a refuge for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange where he spent time working on WikiLeaks. It is a country that has seen several major corruption scandals in the past decade, including ties to Trump Soho through investments by the FL Group.\r\n\r\nIceland is also the oldest parliamentary system, dating back more than 1,000 years. The country is a world leader in women\'s rights, boasting the highest status of women of any country according to the World Economic Forum\'s gender gap index, and has the largest percentage of women in parliament of any country without a quota system - 48 percent.\r\n\r\nThe country has a strong environmental movement, running almost entirely on renewable energy, and a strong direct democracy movement. The constitution was re-written by crowdsourcing input from the public, and the young populist Pirate Party party has 15 percent of parliamentary seats.\r\nWhy did the government collapse?\r\n\r\nIn September the Bright Future party pulled out of a centre-right coalition government, forcing snap elections, after it was revealed that Benedikt Sveinsson, the father of the Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, had written to the Ministry of the Interior a letter of support to \"restore the honour\" of a convicted pedophile.\r\n\r\nThe entire affair, kept out of public sight, was uncovered by members of the Pirate Party and the Left-Greens after another controversial \"restoring the honour\" in a sexual abuse case gained public attention.\r\nHow does the vote work?\r\n\r\nIceland\'s Parliament, called the Althing, is comprised of 63 representatives who are elected from six provinces by proportional representation. Voting is done by paper ballot, avoiding the pitfalls of potential electronic vote hacking and fraud that the United States is now contending with. The election is set for Saturday, but voting has been open for several weeks in various locations.\r\n\r\nThe president of Iceland, Guoni Johannesson, who is elected in a separate voting process, gives the mandate to form a government typically to the party with the most votes. The centre-right Independence Party has led the Parliament for a great majority of the past 73 years that the country has been independent.\r\nWhy does the Independence Party keep winning?\r\n\r\nThat\'s the question many voters keep asking themselves.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s what people are familiar with\", or \"it\'s how their parents voted\", is how most people explain the steady support for the Independence Party.\r\n\r\nDuring the run-up to last year\'s parliamentary elections, international interest was piqued by the possibility that the Pirate Party would take over after they started polling far ahead of the pack. But the Pirates ended up finishing third behind the Independence Party and the Left-Greens, with 10 parliamentary seats.\r\n\r\nPresident Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson gave the mandate first to the Independence Party, then to the Left-Greens, then to the Pirates. All were unsuccessful in forming a coalition government. After three months, the Independence Party finally put together a coalition with the Bright Future and Reform parties.\r\nWho is going to win the elections?\r\n\r\nIcelanders often say everyone in Iceland is an artist or poet, and during this election cycle it feels like almost everyone is running for office. There are dozens of small parties across the country, and new ones form every year. There are 10 parties on the ballot for Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe question many Icelanders are asking themselves is not who will win, but who they should even vote for. And, of course, there are apps to help. One app, provided by RUV, the state TV channel, allows users to select answers to a series of questions about the issues, and then the app ranks which party the user most closely aligns with. The app has had more than 100,000 views.\r\n\r\nWhoever takes power will have a lot to contend with. Because of the snap elections, there is no budget yet for 2018, and a number of groups are planning to strike in reaction to the massive 40 percent pay rise that was handed down to MPs and government bureaucrats following last years elections.');
